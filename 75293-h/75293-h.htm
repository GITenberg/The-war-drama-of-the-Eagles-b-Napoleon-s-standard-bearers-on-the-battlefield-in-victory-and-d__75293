<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">This</span> book breaks fresh ground in a field of
romantic and widespread interest; one that
should prove attractive, associated as it is with
the ever-fascinating subject of Napoleon. Incidentally,
indeed, it may also help to throw
a new sidelight on certain characteristics of
Napoleon as a soldier.</p>

<p>I venture to hope at the same time that it
will arouse interest further as offering independent
testimony to the valour of our own soldiers, the
Old British Army which, under Wellington, defeated
on the battlefield the veterans of the
Eagles whose feats of heroism and hardihood
are described in the book. Magnificent as were
the acts of fine daring and heroic endurance of
the men whom Wellington led to victory, no
less stirring and deserving of admiration were
the deeds of chivalrous valour and stern fortitude
done for the honour of Napoleon’s Eagles by
the gallant soldiers who faced them and proved
indeed foemen worthy of their steel. All who
hold in regard cool, self-sacrificing bravery
and steadfast courage in adversity and peril<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
will find no lack of instances in the stories of
what the warriors of the Eagles dared and underwent
for the name and fame of the Great Captain.</p>

<p>The record of Napoleon’s Eagles in war has
never before been set forth, and the centenary
year of Badajoz and Salamanca and the Moscow
Campaign seems to offer a befitting occasion
for its appearance.</p>

<p>The world, indeed, is in the midst of a cycle
of Napoleonic centenaries. Our own centenary
memories of Talavera—the victory of which
Wellington said, in later years, that if his Allies
had done their part, “it would have been as
great a battle as Waterloo”—of Busaco ridge
and Torres Vedras, of heroic Barrosa and desperate
Albuhera,—these are only just behind us.
Immediately ahead lie the centenaries of yet
greater events. In less than a twelvemonth
hence England will mark the centenary of
Vittoria, Wellington’s decisive day in Spain,
the crowning triumph of the Peninsular War;
and yet more than that in its import and sequel
for Europe. It was the news of Vittoria that,
in July 1813, decided Napoleon’s father-in-law
to throw Austria’s sword into the balance against
the Man of Destiny, compelling Napoleon, with
what remained of the Grand Army, to stand at
bay for the “Battle of the Nations” on the
Marchfeldt before Leipsic. Within six months
from then, the world, in like manner, will recall
the Farewell of Fontainebleau, and Elba; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
finally, in the year after that, the British Empire
will commemorate the epoch-making centenary
of the greatest of all British triumphs in arms
on <span class="locked">land—</span></p>

<p>The stories told here exist indeed, even in
France, only in more or less fragmentary form,
scattered broadcast amongst the memoirs left
by the men of the Napoleonic time. They have
not before been brought together within the
covers of a book.</p>

<p>I have utilised, in addition to the personal
memoirs of Napoleon’s officers, French regimental
records, bulletins, and despatches
(noted in my List of Authorities), other official
military documents, contemporary newspapers,
both British and foreign, and information kindly
placed at my disposal by the authorities of
Chelsea Royal Hospital and the Royal United
Service Institution, and by friends abroad.</p>

<span class="subhead">NAPOLEON ADOPTS THE EAGLE OF CAESAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Napoleon Bonaparte</span> became Emperor, “by
Divine Will and the Constitution of the French
Republic”—Imperator and hereditary Caesar
of the Republic—on Friday, May 18, 1804.
Three weeks later it was publicly announced
in the <i>Moniteur</i> that the Eagle had been adopted
as the heraldic cognisance of the new <i lang="fr">régime</i>
in France.</p>

<p>Its selection for the State armorial bearing
of the Empire was one of Napoleon’s first acts.
That the Roman lictor’s axe and fasces surmounted
by the red Phrygian cap, with its
traditions of revolution, which had supplanted
the Fleur-de-Lis of the Monarchy, and had
served as the official badge on the standards
of the Republic and the Consulate, should
continue under the Imperial <i lang="fr">régime</i>, was
obviously impossible. But what distinctive
emblem should be adopted in its stead?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>

<p>Napoleon had the question debated in his
presence at the first <i lang="fr">séance</i> of the Imperial
Council of State. He had, it would seem, not
made up his mind in regard to it. At any
rate, a few days before the meeting of the
Council, he had directed a Committee to draw
up a statement and offer suggestions.</p>

<p>The matter was brought forward at the first
meeting of the Imperial Council, held at the
Château of Saint-Cloud on Tuesday, June 12,
1804, after a preliminary discussion on the
arrangements for the Coronation, when and
where it should be held, and what was to be
the form of ceremonial. The Coronation, all
agreed at the outset, must take place in the
current year. Rheims, Aix-la-Chapelle, and
Paris, in turn, were suggested as suitable places
for the ceremony, Paris being finally decided
on; the scene of the event to be the Champ de
Mars. Napoleon himself proposed the Champs
de Mars, with a threefold ceremony there—the
taking of the constitutional oath, the actual
coronation, the presentation of the Emperor
to the assembled people. A brief discussion
followed on the form of the coronation ceremony,
whether it should be accompanied by
religious rites. It was put forward that, as
Charlemagne had received his authority from
the Pope, might not the Pope now be induced
to visit Paris and personally crown the Emperor?
Napoleon, intervening in the discussion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
made a strong point of the necessity of some
kind of religious service on the occasion. He
did not care much, he cynically remarked, what
religion was selected; only it must be in
accordance with the views of the majority of
the nation. It would be impossible to do
without some sort of religious observance. In
all nations, said he, Ceremonies of State were
accompanied by religious services. As to
asking the Pope to take part, from his point of
view, at the moment, the attendance of a Papal
legate would be preferable. If the Pope himself
came to Paris, his presence would assuredly
tend to relegate the Emperor to a secondary
position: “Tout le monde me laisserait pour
courir voir le Pape!” The matter, however,
as the discussion proceeded, seemed to present
so many difficulties, that the Council, after
declaring themselves generally against having
any religious ceremony at all, decided to leave
the question for further consideration.</p>

<p>On that the Council turned to deal with the
selection of the heraldic insignia and official
badge of the Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GALLIC COCK PROPOSED</div>

<p>Senator Crétet, on behalf of the special
Committee appointed by Napoleon to prepare
a statement for the Council, presented his
report. The Committee, he said, had decided
unanimously to recommend the Cock, the
historic national emblem of Ancient Gaul,
as the most fitting cognisance for Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
France. Should that not find favour with the
Council, either the Eagle, the Lion, or the
Elephant, in the opinion of the Committee,
might well be adopted. Individual members
of the Committee, added Crétet, had further
suggested the Aegis of Minerva, or some flower
like the Fleur-de-Lis, an Oak-tree, or an Ear
of Corn.</p>

<p>Miot, one of the members of the Council,
rose as Crétet sat down, and protested against
the re-introduction of the Fleur-de-Lis. That,
he said, was imbecility. He proposed a figure
of the Emperor seated on his throne as the
best possible badge for the French Empire.</p>

<p>He was not seconded, however, and Napoleon
interposed abruptly to set aside the Committee’s
suggestion of reviving the Gallic Cock.
He dismissed that notion with a contemptuous
sneer. “Bah,” he exclaimed, “the Cock
belongs to the farmyard! It is far too feeble
a creature!” (“Le Coq est de basse cour.
C’est un animal trop faible!”) Napoleon spoke
rapidly and vivaciously. He had not yet, in
those early days, acquired the impressive Imperial
style that he afterwards affected. “His
language at these earlier Council meetings was
still impregnated with his original Jacobin
style; he spoke frequently, spontaneously,
familiarly; monologued at the top of his voice
(avec des éclats de voix); apostrophised frequently,
appearing at times as though overcome<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
with nervousness, now almost in tears, now
breaking out in a frenzy of passion, unrestrainedly
emphasising his personal likes and
dislikes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LION—THE ELEPHANT—THE BEE</div>

<p>Count Ségur, Imperial Grand Master of the
Ceremonies, suggested the Lion as the most
suitable emblem: “parcequ’il vaincra le
Léopard,” he explained.</p>

<p>Councillor Laumond proposed the adoption
of the Elephant instead; with for a motto
“<i lang="fr">Mole et Mente</i>.” The Elephant had a great
vogue at that day among European heraldic
authorities as being pre-eminently a royal
beast. There was a widely prevalent belief,
on the authority of old writers on natural
history, that an Elephant could not be made
to bow its knees. Further, too, the elephant
typified resistless strength as well as magnanimity.
And had not Caesar himself once
placed the effigy of the Elephant on the Roman
coinage? Nobody else at the Council, however,
seemed to care for the Elephant.</p>

<p>Councillor Simon objected to Ségur’s proposition,
on the score that the Lion was essentially
an aggressive beast.</p>

<p>Cambacérès, ex-Consul and Arch-Chancellor
of the Empire, suggested a swarm of Bees
as the most suitable national emblem. It would
represent the actual situation of France, he
explained—a republic with a presiding chief.</p>

<p>Councillor Lacuèe supported Cambacérès. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
Bee, he added, was the more suitable, in that
it possessed a sting as well as being a maker of
honey.</p>

<p>Cambacérès remarked that he favoured the
idea of the Bee as typifying peaceful industry
rather than offensive power.</p>

<p>The other members took no interest in the
idea of the Bee, and after some discursive
talk the Council fell back on the Committee’s
original suggestion of the historic Gallic Cock.
The general voice favoured the adoption of
the Cock, and they unanimously voted for it.</p>

<p>That, however, would not do for Napoleon.
He sharply refused once more to hear of the
Cock in any circumstances. He had for some
minutes sat silent, listening to the discussion
until the vote was taken. On that he rose
and banned the Cock absolutely and finally.</p>

<p>“The Cock is quite too weak a creature,”
he exclaimed. “A thing like that cannot
possibly be the cognisance of an Empire such
as France. You must make your choice between
the Eagle, the Elephant, and the Lion!”</p>

<p>The Eagle, however, did not commend itself
to the Council. That emblem, it was pointed
out by several members, had been already
adopted by other European nations. For
France, such being the case, the Eagle would
not be sufficiently distinctive. The German
Empire had the Eagle for its cognisance. So
had Austria. So had Prussia. So had Poland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
even—the White Eagle of the Jagellons. The
Council was plainly not attracted by the Eagle.</p>

<p>Lebrun, the other ex-Consul, Arch-Treasurer
of the Empire, now put in a word again for
the Fleur-de-Lis. It had been, he said, the
national emblem of France under all the previous
dynasties. The Fleur-de-Lis, declared Lebrun,
was the real historic emblem of France, and
he proposed that it should be adopted for
the Empire.</p>

<p>Nobody, though, supported him, one member,
Councillor Regnaud, condemning the idea of
the Fleur-de-Lis as utterly out of date. “The
nation,” added Regnaud, with a sneer, “will
neither go back to the cult of the Lilies nor to
the religion of Rome!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“YOU MUST CHOOSE THE LION!”</div>

<p>At that point Napoleon lost patience. Interposing
to close the discussion, he curtly bade
the Council to cease from wasting time. They
must decide on the Lion for the Imperial
Emblem. His preference was for the figure of
a Lion, lying over the map of France, with one
paw stretched out across the Rhine: “Il faut
prendre un Lion, s’étendu sur la carte de France,
la patte prête à dépasser le Rhin.” Napoleon
proposed in addition, by way of motto, beneath
the Lion-figure, these defiant words: “<i lang="fr">Malheur
à qui me cherche!</i>”</p>

<p>No more was said on the subject after that.
The Council submitted forthwith to Napoleon’s
dictation, and, as it would appear, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
taking any formal vote, passed to the remaining
business of the day: the inscription on the
new coinage and certain amendments to the
Criminal Code.</p>

<p>But even then, as it befell, the decision as
to the national emblem was not conclusive.
Napoleon changed his mind about the Lion
shortly after the Council had broken up. The
Lion as the designated cognisance of the French
Empire did not last twenty-four hours. Napoleon
himself, on the report of the Council
meeting being presented for his signature,
definitely rejected the Lion. He cancelled his
own proposition with a stroke of his pen. With
his own hand the Emperor struck out the
words “Lion couchant,” with the reference
to the map of France and the Rhine, writing
over the erasure, “Un Aigle éploye”—an
Eagle with extended wings. So Napoleon independently
settled the matter.</p>

<p>Napoleon, as it would appear, in making
his ultimate choice of the Eagle, had this in his
mind. Charlemagne was ever in his thoughts
at that time as his own destined exemplar.
The Eagle of Charlemagne, it was now borne
in upon his mind irresistibly, had a pre-eminent
claim to be recalled and become the national
heraldic badge for the new Frankish Empire
of the West, as having been the traditional
emblem of Imperial authority in the ancient
Frankish Empire, the prototype and historic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
predecessor of the Empire of which he was
head. Said Napoleon, indeed, in justifying his
final adoption of the Eagle: “Elle affirme la
dignité Impériale et rappelait Charlemagne.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHERE THE ARTIST GOT HIS DESIGN</div>

<p>A commission to design the new Imperial
Eagle “after that of Charlemagne” was forthwith
given to Isabey (the elder Isabey—Jean
Baptiste), “Peintre et Dessinateur du Cabinet
de l’Empereur,” whose reputation was at that
moment at its zenith. The artist, however,
had no Carlovingian model to draw from,
and nobody, it would appear, could give him
any advice. He had to depict “Un Aigle
éployé”—a Spread-Eagle. Discarding heraldic
conventionalism, he produced the Napoleonic
Eagle of history; an Eagle <i lang="fr">au naturel</i>, shown
in the act of taking wing. The idea of it Isabey
took from a sketch he himself had made nine
years before, in the Monastery of the Certosa
of Milan, of an eagle sculptured on one of the
tombs of the Visconti.</p>

<p>Following on his adoption of the Eagle for
the cognisance of the Empire at large, Napoleon
announced that the Eagle would in future
be the battle-standard of the Army. He had,
though, as to that Eagle, yet another thought
in his mind. For his soldiers he desired the
French Eagle to represent the military standard
of Ancient Rome, the historic emblem of
Caesar’s legionaries, with its resplendent traditions
of world-wide victory. That intention,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
furthermore, Napoleon went out of his way
to emphasise significantly through the place
and moment that he chose for the promulgation
of the Army Order appointing the Eagle of
the Caesars as the battle-standard of the French
Empire. The Imperial rescript was dated from
the Camp of the “Army of the Ocean” at
Boulogne; from amidst the vast array of
soldiers mustered there for the threatened invasion
of England.</p>

<p>At the same time Isabey’s design for one
Eagle would suffice as a model for the other.
It sufficiently suggested the Roman type. Like
Charlemagne, had not Napoleon led his army
across the Alps? like Caesar, was he not about
to lead it across the Straits?</p>

<p>“The Eagle with wings outspread, as on the
Imperial Seal, will be at the head of the standard-staves,
as was the practice in the Roman army—(<i lang="fr">placée
au sommet du bâton, telle que la portaient
les Romains</i>). The flag will be attached at the
same distance beneath the Eagle, as was the
Labarum.” So Napoleon wrote in his preliminary
instructions from Boulogne to Marshal
Berthier, Head of the Etat-Major of the “Army
of England,” at that moment on duty at the
War Office in Paris.</p>

<p>The Eagle, Napoleon directed, was of itself
to constitute the standard: “<i lang="fr">Essentiellement
constituer l’étendard</i>,” were Napoleon’s words.
He set a secondary value on the flag which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Eagle surmounted. The flag to Napoleon was
a subsidiary adjunct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLAG OF MINOR ACCOUNT</div>

<p>Flags, of course, would come and go. They
could be renewed, he wrote, as might be necessary,
at any time; every two years, or oftener.
The Eagle, on the other hand, was to be a
permanency. It was to be for all time the
standard of its corps: also, to add still further
to its sacrosanct nature and <i lang="fr">éclat</i>, every Eagle
would be received only from the hands of the
Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Every Battalion of Foot and Squadron of
Horse was to have its Eagle, which, on parade
and before the enemy under fire, would be in
the special charge of the battalion or squadron
sergeant-major, with an escort of picked veteran
soldiers; “men who had distinguished themselves
on the battlefield in at least two combats.”</p>

<p>Exceptional care, Napoleon laid down, was
to be taken by regimental commanders that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
no harm should befall the Eagle. In the event
of accident happening to it, a special report
was to be made direct to the Emperor. Should
it unfortunately happen that the Eagle was
lost in battle, the regiment concerned would
have to prove to the Emperor’s satisfaction
that there had been no default. No new
Eagle would be granted in place of one lost
until the regiment in question had atoned for
the slur on its character by either achieving
“<i lang="fr">éclatante</i>” distinction in the field, by some
exceptionally brilliant feat of arms, or by
presenting the Emperor with an enemy’s standard
“taken by its own valour.”</p>

<p>The silken tricolor flag, as has been said, was
in the eyes of Napoleon of subordinate account.
It was to be considered merely as a set-off to
the Eagle, as merely “<i lang="fr">l’ornement de l’Aigle</i>.”
The Eagle, and the Eagle only, must be the
object of the soldier’s devotion. Napoleon paid
little regard to the flag, beyond as being of use
for displaying the record of a regiment’s war
career. He would have liked indeed, as it
would seem, to substitute another flag altogether,
and went so far as to have designs for a green
regimental flag submitted to him.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Prudence,
however, forbade its introduction, and directions
were issued that the general pattern of tricolor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
standard in use under the Consulate should be
retained, with minor alterations of detail in
the design rendered necessary in consequence
of the new constitution of the State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LEGEND ON THE FLAG</div>

<p>The regimental flags would consist of a white
diamond-shaped centre, with the corners of
the flag alternately red and blue; according
to the pattern authorised two years previously
by Napoleon as First Consul. Thus the national
colours would continue to be represented. For
the Infantry, in the centre of each flag would
be, on one side, the words “Empire Français,”
with the legend, inscribed in letters of gold,
“L’Empereur des Français au —<sup>e</sup> Régiment
d’Infanterie de Ligne,” which would take the
place of the Republican inscription hitherto
borne there; the number of each corps being
inscribed in the blank space and in a laurel
chaplet embroidered at each corner of the flag.
For Cavalry the inscription ran: “L’Empereur
des Français au —<sup>e</sup> Cuirassiers,” or “au —<sup>e</sup>
Chasseurs”; and so on for other corps,
Artillery, Dragoons, and Hussars.</p>

<p>On the reverse, for corps of all arms, with the
exception of the Guard, was emblazoned the
motto “Valeur et Discipline,” and beneath it
the number of the battalion or squadron in
each regiment.</p>

<p>Below the numbers was added any Inscription
of Honour which had been granted to the
corps, such as, in the case of one regiment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
“Le 15<sup>e</sup> est couvert de la Gloire”; in the
case of another, “Le Terrible 57<sup>e</sup> qui rien
n’arrête”; with others, “Le Bon et Brave 28<sup>e</sup>”;
“Le 75<sup>e</sup> arrive et bât l’Ennemi”; “J’étais
tranquille, le brave 32<sup>e</sup> était là”; “Il n’est pas
possible d’être plus brave que le 63<sup>e</sup>”;
“Brave 18<sup>e</sup>, je vous connais. L’Ennemi ne
tiendra pas devant vous”; and so on. These
were mostly quotations from “mentions in despatches”
made by Napoleon in regard to regiments
in his famous “Army of Italy,” authorised by
him, at first of his own initiative, and later as
First Consul, to be recorded as Inscriptions of
Honour on the regimental colours. The flags
of other corps bore names of victories of note
in which the regiments had taken part; as,
for instance, “Rivoli,” “Lodi,” “Marengo.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PROPOSED FOR CORONATION DAY</div>

<p>Napoleon overlooked nothing that might add
to the prestige of his Eagles. Not only would
he himself personally present its Eagle to
each regiment, but, further, there would be at
the outset a general presentation of Eagles in
Paris to the whole Army, which would be made
a State event of significance, and form an integral
part of the ceremony of his Coronation. On
that Napoleon had insisted, in reply to a technical
legal objection raised at one of the meetings of
the Council of State. It was not to be a Parisian
popular show. He was ready, indeed, he said,
to transfer the ceremony to Boulogne. “Je
rassemblerais deux cent mille hommes au camp.
Là j’aurais une population couverte des blessures
dont je serais sûr!” He gave directions that
the Presentation of the Eagles should take
place on the Field of Mars in front of the
Military School, on the same day as the Coronation,
and should follow immediately after the
religious service and his actual crowning and
consecration by the Pope in Notre Dame.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br>

<span class="subhead">THE DAY OF THE PRESENTATION ON THE FIELD OF MARS</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DAY FINALLY FIXED</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Coronation, Napoleon first proposed, should
take place in the Chapel of the Invalides, on the
historic day of the 18th Brumaire (November 9).
Directly after it he would proceed in Imperial
State, wearing his crown and robes, to the Field
of Mars—the Champ de Mars, in front of the
Military School, a stone’s-throw away—there
to administer the Military Oath of Allegiance
to the Army and distribute the Eagles at a
grand review to be attended by representative
deputations from every regiment of the Army
from all over the Empire, assembled in Paris for
the occasion. It was found preferable, however,
that the Coronation service should take place
in the Cathedral of Notre Dame instead of at
the Invalides; and at a later date. Still, however,
Napoleon held to his first idea of proceeding
direct from the Coronation ceremony to the
Field of Mars. He insisted that the presentation
of the Eagles should follow as a joint ceremony
immediately after his own consecration service.
But there was Josephine to be considered. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
was to accompany Napoleon throughout. The
Empress, for her part, on hearing what was
intended, declared herself physically incapable
of bearing the strain of the double ceremony,
and, in the result, Napoleon changed his original
purpose at the eleventh hour. He consented
to put off the presentation of the Eagles until
the following morning. That plan, in turn, had
to be altered. On the very afternoon of the
Coronation, on his return to the Tuileries from
Notre Dame, Napoleon found himself compelled,
in consequence of the Empress’s state of nervous
prostration after the fatiguing Cathedral service,
again to defer the ceremony of the presentation
of the Eagles. The Emperor now fixed the
following Wednesday, December 5, for the
“<i lang="fr">Fête des Aigles</i>,” as the Army spoke of it—three
days from then. There was no further
putting off after that.</p>

<p>The plans for the muster were drawn up on
a grandiose and elaborate scale. They provided
for an immense attendance under arms of,
according to one account, eighty thousand men;
to comprise the Imperial Guard, and the garrison
of Paris, together with special detachments
sent to Paris as representative deputations by
every regiment and corps of the Army, from all
over the Empire. Over a thousand Eagles
altogether were to be presented: two hundred
and eighty to cavalry regiments; six hundred
odd to infantry, artillery, and special corps;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
between forty and fifty to the Navy (one for
the crew of every ship of the Line in commission);
besides a hundred and eight to the departmental
legions of the National Guard, the constitutional
militia of Revolutionary France, which
Napoleon, for reasons of policy, could not pass
over. Every infantry battalion and cavalry
squadron, and brigade (or battery) of artillery
was to have its Eagle.</p>

<p>Each infantry deputation, from both the
Imperial Guard and the Line, would comprise
the colonel or regimental commander, four other
officers, and ten sous-officiers and men from each
of the three battalions that at that period made
up a French regiment of Foot. In all, in addition
to the regiments of the Imperial Guard,
one hundred and twelve regiments of the Line
were to be represented, together with thirty-one
of Light Infantry, twelve of Grenadiers, and
one of foreign infantry. A deputation of fifteen
officers and men was to represent each of the
hundred and odd cavalry regiments of the
Guard and Line; and smaller individual detachments
would represent the various other
arms and branches of the service appointed to
receive Eagles. They would all pass before the
Emperor and receive their Eagles from him
personally, on behalf of their absent comrades,
the six hundred thousand men who at that
moment constituted the active field army of
France. From every French ship of the Line in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
commission there would in like manner attend
ten officers and men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WHOLE ARMY REPRESENTED</div>

<p>From far and near the detachments of soldiers
and sailors converged on the capital, marching
some of them hundreds of miles from the most
distant frontier garrisons of the Empire, and
being several weeks on the road. The deputations
of the First Army Corps, for instance, part
of which was stationed in Hanover, set off early
in October; some of its soldiers, quartered
by the Elbe, and with from four to five hundred
miles of road before them, started in the last
week of September. The detachments from
Italy and the Venetian frontier, for another
instance, the deputations from the 1st of the
Line, the 10th, the 52nd, and 101st of the Verona
garrison, had over eight hundred miles to go,
and started early in September. Quite an army,
indeed, was on the move along the highways
of France during October and November; all
heading for Paris, marching by day and being
billeted in the towns and villages by night.
A huge series of detachments came from the
camp of the “Army of the Ocean” at Boulogne
assembled for the invasion of England. Marshal
Soult, the Commander-in-Chief at Boulogne,
with Marshals Davout and Ney, preceded them,
Admiral Bruix, in charge of the Boulogne
“Invasion Flotilla” of gunboats and transports,
accompanying Soult. The troops in Holland;
the garrisons of the Rhine fortresses, such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Mayence and Strasburg, and of Metz; that of
Bayonne on the Spanish frontier; troops at every
place of arms and cantonment and regimental
dépôt all over France—all sent their deputations;
also every outlying camp, every naval
port along the coast, from the Texel and Antwerp,
Brest, Rochfort, and L’Orient round to Toulon,
in the south.</p>

<p>Orders were given in every case that the
detachments were each to bring the existing regimental
colours, which, it was understood, were to
be given up on parade in exchange for the Eagles.</p>

<p>A roomy expanse of level ground several acres
in extent, an oblong-shaped area nearly three-quarters
of a mile in length and six hundred
yards across, the Field of Mars offered an ideal
place for a showy military spectacle. Thousands
of people could look on comfortably at the display
from the turfed slopes of the twenty-feet-high
embankment which skirted the Field of
Mars on three sides, and had been fitted up by
the municipality with rows of seats in closely
set tiers. As many as three hundred thousand
spectators, indeed, could on occasion be accommodated
there. The fourth side of the
Champ de Mars was bounded by the <i lang="fr">façade</i> of
the Ecole Militaire—three great domed blocks
of buildings connected together and affording
a grand view of the scene for hundreds of privileged
guests. The entire frontage of the
Military School to the height of the first-floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
windows was taken up for the Day of the Eagles
parade by an immense grand-stand, constructed
to form a series of pavilions for the accommodation
of the great official personages invited; with,
in the centre, in front of the lofty colonnaded
portico, a magnificently decorated Imperial
Pavilion, whence Napoleon and Josephine seated
on their thrones would look on and receive
the homage of the Army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEATHER ON THAT MORNING</div>

<p>The only thing that was unpropitious was the
weather. It proved, as far as the weather went,
an unfortunate change of date. The day of the
Coronation, December 2—it was, by the way,
Advent Sunday—had been cold and trying,
with lowering clouds overhead, but dry. On the
Monday, Napoleon’s second choice, it was much
the same out of doors; and on the Tuesday
the weather kept fair. Then, however, it
changed. During Tuesday afternoon the glass
began to go down ominously and a chilly wind
from the south-east set in. Towards ten at
night rain and sleet in incessant showers began
to fall—typical Frimaire weather, in keeping
with the character of the “sleety month.”
“When it did not rain,” says somebody, “it
snowed, and between whiles it rained and snowed
at the same time.” That was what the weather
was like when Wednesday morning broke; but
in spite of it the Imperial programme was to
be carried out in its entirety, and hundreds of
thousands of intending spectators braved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
discomfort and started early to get a good place
for witnessing the historic display.</p>

<p>All Paris turned out early, prepared to sit
out the day from eight in the morning until
probably after four in the afternoon, packed in
dense masses round the Champ de Mars.</p>

<p>The heavy firing of salvos of artillery soon
after dawn, from a dozen points all over Paris,
ushered in the day’s doings. The whole city
was already, as has been said, astir and in the
streets, making its way to the Champ de Mars.
Everywhere dark columns of cloaked soldiers,
horse and foot, artillerymen without their guns,
were tramping along through the slush and mud
for their posts; some to take part on the route
of the procession, which was to start from the
Tuileries; most of them bound for the Field of
Mars. Along the streets to be passed by the
Imperial procession the houses were gaily decked
out with festoons and branches of evergreens,
or with coloured hangings and drapings.
Oriental rugs of gorgeous hues and patterns,
hired or borrowed for the Coronation week,
hung from most of the windows; they were the
favourite form of decoration. Here and there
flags were seen, but it was not the fashion in
Paris at that day to fly flags largely on days of
public rejoicing.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock the cannon again thundered
out an Imperial salute—a hundred and one guns.
All knew what that was for, and there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
hush of expectation all over Paris. The guns
meant that the Emperor had started; that the
Imperial State procession had left the Tuileries.
At that moment the chilly drizzle of sleet was
still coming down, but the universal enthusiasm
rose superior to the wet and cold. No weather
could damp the anticipations of the excited
Parisians over the Imperial spectacle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MURAT COMMANDS THE PARADE</div>

<p>On the Champ de Mars, as the guns began to
fire, the soldiers—all long since in their places
drawn up in closely massed columns, that ranged
right round the parade ground on three sides—stripped
off and rolled up their soaked cloaks,
fixed bayonets, and stood to arms. Murat,
Governor of Paris, Commander-in-Chief on the
parade, took post in front of the Imperial
Pavilion before the Ecole Militaire: a gorgeous
figure in a bright blue velvet uniform coat,
resplendently embroidered with gold, a lilac
sash with crimson stripes round his waist; in
scarlet breeches braided with gold, purple leather
Hessians, trimmed and tasselled with gold, with
gleaming gold spurs and sabre-scabbard; wearing
a Marshal’s cocked hat with crimson ostrich-plumes,
and mounted on a no less splendidly
caparisoned charger, with leopard-skin and
crimson and gold saddle-trappings. A brilliant
<i lang="fr">entourage</i> of staff officers and dandy aides de
camp, daintily attired in pearl-grey uniforms,
with silver lace, or in crimson and green and
gold, clustered in rear of their chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<p>Simultaneously, the massed bands of the
Imperial Guard, who had been playing national
airs and popular music at times during the past
hour, formed to the front near by.</p>

<p>For the time being, until after the Emperor
should arrive and take his seat on the throne,
the troops on parade, comprising the Army
deputations to receive the Eagles, remained
as they had been marshalled on arrival; arranged
in a vast fan-shaped formation round
three sides of the Champ de Mars. The entire
Imperial Army of Napoleon stood represented
within that space: Imperial Guard, and Line,
Cavalry and Artillery; the sailors of the Navy;
the National Guard,—the <i lang="fr">mise en scène</i> presenting
a tremendous impression of martial power, as
all stood formed up in close order, in their full-dress
review-uniforms, muskets held stiffly at the
support, bayonets fixed.</p>

<p>The Imperial procession set off in full State,
accompanied by much the same display of
martial pomp that had attended the great
Coronation progress to Notre Dame of three
days before. It moved off in a pelting squall
of sleet; but, almost immediately afterwards,
as though Heaven would fain spare the show,
within a few minutes of the start, the sleet and
rain ceased and the weather unexpectedly improved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAMELUKES LEAD THE WAY</div>

<p>Foremost of all, the mounted Mamelukes of
the Guard came prancing by, radiant in Oriental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
garb, their curved scimitars drawn and gleaming;
a hundred swarthy figures in scarlet calpacks
swathed round with white turbans, garbed in
vivid green burnous-cloaks well thrown back to
display gold-embroidered scarlet jackets, bright
straw-coloured sashes, and baggy scarlet trousers.
Their famous Horse-tail Standard headed the
squadron. Eight hundred stalwart troopers of
Napoleon’s pet regiment, the corps whose
uniform he always wore in camp, the Chasseurs
of the Guard, followed immediately after the
Mamelukes. An ideal <i lang="fr">corps d’élite</i> they looked
as they rode by, in their bristling busbies of
dark fur topped with waving crimson and green
plumes, dark green double-breasted jackets, and
crimson breeches; with crimson pelisses hanging
at the shoulder, fur-trimmed and barred with
yellow braid in hussar style. These two corps
led the van of the procession.</p>

<p>The first set of Imperial coaches, with six
horses each and outriders, thereupon came by.
They carried mostly State magnificos and
grandees of exalted position at Court. Coach
after coach went slowly past at a dignified pace:
eight—nine—ten—eleven—conveyances, all spick
and span with new gilding and varnish. The
twelfth coach, beside which rode a bevy of
smart equerries, held the Princesses of the
Bonaparte family: five grown-up ladies and the
little daughter of Princess Louis. It was
rather a tight squeeze, for the five Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Highnesses were plump and bulky persons, and
had to be wedged closely; they brought with
them too, each lady, several yards of train,
brocaded stuff with stiff edging of gilt-gimp,
and thick purple and emerald green velvet
mantling, which had all to be got in and kept
from crumpling as much as possible! What
they said to one another has not been recorded—they
were usually free-spoken women with
comments for most things ready to their tongues,
like other daughters of the Revolution. At any
rate this is known. They were in white silk
dresses, low necked, and, in spite of their close
packing, shivered with the cold, which they felt
bitterly. “We were all,” related a Lady of
Honour elsewhere in the procession, “thinly
dressed, as for a heated ball-room, and had only
thin Cashmere shawls to keep our shoulders
warm with.”</p>

<p>Then came more soldiers. The immediate
escort of the Emperor now appeared. Sitting
erect and stiff in their saddles, the Carabiniers
rode up—the senior cavalry regiment of France—eight
hundred picked horsemen uniformed in
Imperial blue and crimson and gold, with helmets
of burnished brass, over which nodded thick
tufted crests of crimson wool. The officers,
superb beings adorned with breastplates of
gleaming brass, led the regiment. The Carabiniers
claimed to be the only corps of the
Napoleonic Army which could prove continuity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
with the Old Royal Army, if not indeed with
the historic “Maison du Roi” itself, the Household
Brigade of the Monarchy, owing to a
curious oversight at the Revolution through
which the regiment had escaped dispersal.</p>

<p>Then came the Man of the Hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMPERIAL COACH APPEARS</div>

<p>Napoleon now appeared, in his brand-new
Imperial State coach. Eight noble bays drew
it—with harness and trappings of red morocco
leather studded with golden bees. A marvellous
vehicle to look at was Napoleon’s coach, gleaming
all over with gilded carved work; its roof
topped by a great golden crown, modelled “after
that of Charlemagne,” as people told one another,
upheld by four glistening gilded eagles. The
State coach sparkled all over, looking as if
encrusted with gold; a gleaming mass of carved
and gilded decorations, representing allegorical
emblems, heraldic designs, and coats of arms in
colour.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s head coachman of the Consulate
days, César, sat on the box, his fat form embedded
in the centre of a luxurious hammer-cloth
of scarlet velvet, spangled over with
golden bees. Outriders in green and gold and
walking footmen beside the horses added their
part; also half a score of Pages of Honour, hanging
on all round at the sides and back of the coach,
in green velvet coats, gold laced down the seams,
with green silk shoulder-knots, scarlet silk
breeches and stockings, and white ostrich-plumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
in their jaunty black velvet hats: most of the
lads future officers of the Guard. At either
side rode Equerries and <i lang="fr">Officiers d’Ordonnance</i>,
in white and gold or pale blue and silver.</p>

<p>To the crowds that lined the streets the State
coach was a sight of the day—the coach, for
some, as much as the Emperor. All Paris,
of course, had not been able to find room round
the Field of Mars, spacious as the accommodation
there was. The pavements all along the streets
from the Tuileries were packed with a dense
crowd, which pressed everywhere close up behind
the double rows of Gendarmes and Imperial
Guardsmen keeping the processional route.</p>

<p>They shouted “Vive l’Empereur!” lustily,
for all had a good view of Napoleon through the
great glass windows of the coach; seated inside
on the right, wearing his ostrich-feathered cap
of semi-State, a gold embroidered purple velvet
mantle, and the Grand Master’s collar of the
Legion of Honour, sparkling with costly gems.</p>

<p>Josephine, a slender figure in ermine cloak
and white silk dress, sat on Napoleon’s left, and
on the front seats sat Joseph and Louis, side
by side—the elder brother sleek and smiling,
wrapped up in a poppy-red cloak as Grand
Elector of the Empire; Louis Bonaparte wearing
his blue velvet Constable’s mantle over the
brass breastplate of the Colonel-in-Chief of the
Carabiniers, to which rank Napoleon had specially
promoted Louis, with the idea of maintaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
an old tradition of the Monarchy that the titular
Commander of the Carabiniers should always
be a Prince of the Blood, “<i lang="fr">Frère du Roi</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHIEFS OF THE “MAISON MILITAIRE”</div>

<p>Napoleon’s Imperial Standard was borne
immediately after the State coach; a crowned
eagle heading the staff; the flag a silken tricolor,
richly fringed with gold and bespangled with
golden bees.</p>

<p>Four of the Marshals, readily recognised by
their scarlet ostrich-plumes and gold-tipped
bâtons of command, attended the Standard, and,
as Colonels-General of the Imperial Guard, led
the Imperial Military Household, the “Maison
Militaire de l’Empereur.” The four were:
Davout, titular chief of the Grenadiers of the
Guard; Soult, Colonel-General of the Chasseurs;
Bessières, of the Heavy Cavalry; Mortier, of
the Guard Artillery. Close behind them four
other gorgeously brilliant officers of rank rode
abreast, the Colonels-General of the Cavalry
of the Army: St. Cyr, of the Cuirassiers, disdainful
and sardonic of mien; stern Baraguay
d’Hilliers, of the Dragoons; good-looking Junot,
Colonel-General of the Hussars; and Napoleon’s
son-in-law, the chivalrous Eugène Beauharnais,
Colonel-General of Chasseurs. A brilliant
cavalcade of little less resplendent cavaliers,
the Emperor’s aides de camp, all of them Generals
of Division or Brigadiers, rounded up the
group.</p>

<p>Another eye-surfeit of gleaming varnish, gilded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
carvings, and green liveries continued the
pageant: twelve other State coaches, six-horsed
like those in advance; carrying the personal
suites of Napoleon and Josephine and the
Princesses, Court Chamberlains and similar gold-embroidered
functionaries, Ladies of the Palace
and “Officers of the Crown.” The procession
ended after them; the rear being brought up
by the Mounted Grenadiers of the Guard,
strapping troopers in huge bear-skins—soldiers
picked for their height and bearing from the
Cavalry of the Line—and the Gendarmerie
d’Elite, who formed the Imperial palace-guard.</p>

<p>More than half the Imperial Guard—numbering,
in 1804, ten thousand officers and men—lined
the streets under arms; detachments of Grenadiers
and Vélites, Foot-Chasseurs, Veterans of
the Guard, Marines of the Guard. Through
double rows of these, all standing with presented
arms, the procession took its way, passing from
the Tuileries Gardens, across the Place de Concorde
and over the bridge there, to the Esplanade
des Invalides. Yet another thundering Imperial
salute from the twenty old cannons of the Batterie
Triomphale greeted Napoleon at that point;
while rows of old soldiers, the maimed veterans
of Arcola and Rivoli and Marengo, shouted
themselves hoarse, standing ranged in front of
the Outer Court beside Napoleon’s Venetian
trophy, kept there temporarily, the Lion of St.
Mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>From the Invalides, by way of the Rue de
Grenelle, it was not far to the Military School.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WITHIN THE MILITARY SCHOOL</div>

<p>Withindoors at the Ecole Militaire a pause was
made in the Governor’s apartments, which
had been sumptuously furnished for the occasion
from the Imperial storerooms of the <i lang="fr">Garde
Meuble</i>. Napoleon here accepted a number of
selected addresses from the military delegations.
One of them was brought by the regimental
deputation of the 4th Chasseurs stationed at
Boulogne. It thanked the Emperor in advance
for the new standard he was presenting to the
corps, “trusting that the day is at hand when
we shall be able to contribute towards consolidating
the splendour of the Empire by planting
our Eagle on the Tower of London.” The
Emperor also received the congratulations of
the Ambassadors and Diplomatic Corps. Ten
hereditary German Princes of the Rhineland,
visiting Paris for the Coronation, attended at
the Military School to witness the Presentation
of the Eagles; at their head the Prince-Bishop-Elector
of Ratisbon, Arch-Chancellor of the
German Empire, the Margrave of Baden, and the
Princes of Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Homburg.
Napoleon and Josephine after that withdrew
to assume their crowns and Imperial regalia
and pass outside to the two thrones prepared
for them and standing side by side in the grand
central pavilion in front.</p>

<p>The vast array of “guests of the Emperor,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
seated outside, had of course been long since
in their places, awaiting the advent of their
Majesties amid surroundings designed on a
scale of lavish magnificence regardless of cost.</p>

<p>On either hand pavilions and galleries and
platforms, canopied and carpeted, draped and
curtained and hung in crimson and gold, decorated
with festoons and banners, and fenced
with gilded balustrading, covered the whole
length of the <i lang="fr">façade</i> of the Ecole Militaire fronting
the parade ground. In the centre stood the
Imperial Pavilion, beneath a canopy of crimson
silk supported by tall gilded columns. Side
galleries draped, and under awnings led from it
right and left to two other pavilions, at either
end of the <i lang="fr">façade</i>, similarly adorned in lavish
gorgeousness. Below the galleries extended
long stands, sloping forward to the ground,
draped in green and crimson, and packed with
rows of seats five or six deep. Here, partly
in the open, sat the provincial Coronation guests
from the Departments: the local prefects and
sub-prefects, procurators, magistrates and
syndics, mayors and councillors, and other
municipal functionaries, all in gala-day attire
of every colour, plumes in their hats, and buttons
and embroidery all over their coats. They
made a many-hued show in the mass, seen from
the parade ground. The higher State dignitaries
had seats under the canopies of the
galleries, and looked yet more decorative.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Seated in the pavilions on cushioned chairs were
the Ambassadors and Foreign Princes, the Senate,
Corps Legislatif, and Tribunate, High Court
Judges in flowing robes of flame-coloured silk,
and velvet-clad “Grand Officers of the Empire,”
in full-dress all. They looked imposing and
magnificent, but most of them were shivering,
with damp bodies and numbed fingers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE IMPERIAL PAVILION</div>

<p>The sleet had stopped for the time, but after
the all-night’s downpour of rain and snow the
seats everywhere were in a sad condition.
Canopies and cushions, curtains, seats, carpets—everything
had been drenched through and
swamped during the night. The discomfort,
however, was past helping and had to be borne.
The Imperial Pavilion itself indeed had not
escaped a wetting, and in parts it was in little
better condition than the other places. “Only
with the greatest diligence,” describes one of the
suite, “had it been possible to keep the thrones
dry.”</p>

<p>Napoleon’s throne, with beside it the throne
for Josephine, at a slightly lower elevation, stood
at the front of the Imperial Pavilion. A gilt-framed
crimson velvet Chair of State was
provided for the Emperor, with a crowned eagle
in gilt stucco perched on the back; made on the
model of Dagobert’s chair on which Napoleon
had sat during the ceremony of the distribution
of the Crosses of the Legion of Honour at
Boulogne. As on that day, so now, trophies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
captured battle-flags adorned the back of the
Imperial daïs, selected from the two hundred
and odd standards taken in battle by the Armies
of Italy and Egypt which Napoleon had led in
person: trophies of Montenotte and Arcola, of
Tagliamento and Lodi, of Rivoli and Castiglione;
the red-and-white banner of the Knights of
Malta; the green Horse-tail Standard of the
Beys of Egypt; Austrian standards won by
Napoleon at the crowning triumph of Marengo.</p>

<p>To right and left of the Emperor, on richly
decorated chairs of ceremony, Joseph and Louis
Bonaparte and the Princesses were seated.
The Imperial suites in attendance were grouped
at the back together with a cluster of court
grandees, filling most of the spacious platform
behind the throne.</p>

<p>In the forefront, at the Emperor’s right hand,
stood a splendid galaxy of stalwart figures—the
Marshals of the Empire. They stood forward
prominently. For them that was the day
of days. All must see on such a day the champion
warriors of France, the renown of whose
victories had filled the world! The whole
eighteen were there—all except one. Marshal
Brune alone was absent; on service out of
France as Napoleon’s Ambassador at Constantinople.
The group was completed by the four
“Honorary Marshals”—the veteran Kellermann,
the victor of Valmy; Perignon; Serrurier; and
Lefebvre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LIEUTENANTS OF THE WAR LORD</div>

<p>Glance for one moment round the main group
of thirteen, the chosen lieutenants of Napoleon
the War Lord, as they stand beside their Chief,
with, arrayed in front, the serried columns of
the destined victors of Austerlitz. Next to the
Emperor and the Eagles it is they who on this
Day of the Eagles are the principal objects of
interest to the general spectator.</p>

<p>Let the reader for one moment imagine himself
on the Imperial Pavilion, with at his side
a convenient friend who knows everybody, to
point the marshals out.</p>

<p>That short, spare, low-browed, swarthy,
Italian-faced man, with crafty, pitiless eyes, is
Masséna—“L’Enfant chéri de la Victoire,”
as Napoleon himself hailed him on the battlefield;
the very ablest undoubtedly of all the
Marshals. He knows it too. When the list of
the Marshals first came out, a friend called on
Masséna to know if it was true that he was one,
and to congratulate him. “Oh yes, thank you,”
replied Masséna in an icy tone, puckering up his
dark face with a sour look, “I am one; <em>one of
fourteen</em>!” He’s Italian in blood and breeding,
and in his tricky ways; every point about him:
but he’d give his soul to be a Frenchman!
“Massène” is what he is always trying to get
people to call him. And the airs and self-importance
he assumes—though only like most
of the others in that, indeed—ever since he
became “Monseigneur le Maréchal” and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
had the honour of being addressed as “Mon
Cousin” by the Emperor! Just think of it!
In the old days, behind the counter of that little
olive-oil and dried-fruit shop up a narrow,
smelly back street at Antibes, plain “Citoyen
André” was good enough! Just look at that
thin, pouting chest, gleaming all over with gold
embroidery, with the broad crimson riband of
the Legion of Honour slanting across it, and
the aggressive tilt of his ostrich-plumed hat!
Imagine all that being once upon a time just
a cabin-boy on a Marseilles to Leghorn coaster,
half-starved and sworn at and cuffed and kicked
about by a curmudgeonly <i lang="it">padrone</i>! Then fancy
it a sneaking smuggler, chevied about, and
crouching along to keep out of carbine shot
of the Nice <i lang="fr">douaniers</i>! After that Sergeant
Masséna of the late King’s <i lang="it">Royal Italien</i> regiment
of the Line! And so to the bâton.</p>

<p>They are most of them rather <i lang="fr">tête montée</i>
just now, with their exaltation spick and span
on them, these demi-gods of war of ours! Just
see them in the field, or on the march; away
from the Emperor. They stalk ahead in solitary
grandeur; each with his own <i lang="fr">pas seul</i>, keeping
the lesser creation at arms’ length, wrapped up
in his own dignified importance. Yet only six
months since their lofty Excellencies were mere
generals of division, “Citoyen Général” this or
that, each one; just units among a hundred
and twenty odd others! Nowadays, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
march, your Marshal rides by himself, forty
yards ahead of everybody; his staff have to
tail off well in rear and keep back! M. le
Maréchal doesn’t deign to open his lips, except
to give an order. He lives by himself: nobody
now is good enough to ask to dinner, except
perhaps another marshal! No off-duty pleasantries
nowadays; no more <i lang="fr">bon camaraderie</i>;
no more telling of Palais-Royal stories,
as it used to be; no more cracking of jokes
beside the bivouac fire. You might as well
expect a bishop to have a game of marbles!
Let a former brother-officer <i lang="fr">tutoyer</i> a marshal!
Poor fellow! Let him try, if he wants to know
what a paralysing, rasping, cold-blooded snub
is, to get a flattening backhander he’ll remember
as long as he wears the uniform.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO FAMOUS HARD FIGHTERS</div>

<p>That tall, bull-necked, heavy-featured man is
Augereau; “gros comme un tambour-major”;
absolutely fearless under fire, kind-hearted to
those he takes a fancy to, they say, but ordinarily
a coarse-tongued swashbuckler, with barrack-room
manners. There too is Lannes, that
keen-eyed, short man, holding his head as if
he had a crick in his neck! He has one, a
permanent one, the result of a bullet under
the jaw from a British marine’s musket in the
trenches at Acre. A hot-tempered, fiery, devil-may-care
fellow is Lannes; but as cold as ice
on the battlefield when things look like going
wrong! Among friends, chivalrous and generous-hearted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
to a degree, his men worship Lannes;
“the Roland of the Grand Army,” some call
him. That is Moncey: and that very tall and
erect, dry, rather dense-looking, hawk-nosed
marshal with the shaggy eyebrows, Mortier.
Mark Bernadotte there, that shifty-eyed Gascon
with a sharp nose and thick hair; of medium
height,—nobody really trusts him. An ingrained
Jacobin—strip his arm and you will
find tattooed on it, indelibly, for life, “Mort
aux rois”—and a schemer, Napoleon named him
a Marshal for political reasons mainly; although,
no doubt, he has the same soldier-qualifications
as the rest; has won a pitched battle or taken
two fortresses. A cunning, plausible fellow is
Bernadotte; with ready smile and a smooth
tongue. He calls everybody “Mon ami” whether
he is talking to a brigadier or a bugler. “Que
diable fait il dans cette galère?” say a good
many people of the Commander of the First
Army Corps. Over yonder stands Bessières,
Murat’s great friend; a gentlemanly enough
fellow, but at times thick-headed, hardly of the
mental calibre of his confrères. Yet Bessières
is an ideal leader of Horse on the battlefield;
as reckless as a lion at bay: you should see him
head a charge sword in hand! One of Napoleon’s
pets is he and the only man in the Army who
sticks to his queue. Bessières flatly refused
to cut it off when the order was given last June
for everybody to copy “Le petit tondu” (“The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
little shorn one”), as the men call the Emperor,
and it hangs halfway down his back.</p>

<p>That dark, sleek-faced, heavy-eyed man is
Jourdan, Commander-in-Chief once of the Army
of the Revolution. “The Anvil,” some call
him, he has been so often soundly beaten.
But, all the same, he was too popular with the
Army for Napoleon to pass him over. Jourdan
it was who invented the conscription system.
He started in life as a linen-draper at Grenoble.
There is of course, too, Brune, who isn’t here
to-day: but he doesn’t count for much. A
minor-poet and a journalist was he once upon
a time. He’s another of the clever-tongued
Jacobins the Emperor gave the bâton to as a
sop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S RIGHT-HAND MAN</div>

<p>Look near the Emperor, at that neat athletic
figure, of middle height: that is “Old Berthier.”
He is from ten to fifteen years older than most
of the other marshals; or, in fact, than the
Emperor himself. Berthier, in fact, is old enough
to have been a captain in the Army of the <i lang="fr">ancien
régime</i>, and can remember how he first smelt
powder fighting under Lafayette and Washington
against the British in America. He was a staff
officer when Napoleon first came to the Ecole
Militaire here from Brienne, as a boy gentleman-cadet.
A heaven-born Chief of the Staff
is Marshal Berthier, and the Emperor without
him in a campaign would be like a man
without his right hand. Every detail goes like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
clockwork with Berthier at the head of the
Etat-Major.</p>

<p>You should see the two of them on campaign,
working together in the Quartier-Général.
Napoleon will be sprawling on his stomach at
full length over a huge set of maps which cover,
spread out, nearly the whole floor of the tent;
an open pair of compasses in his hand, a box of
pins with little paper flag-heads, red, blue, yellow,
green, at one side, some of them already stuck
over the map marking the positions of the
different corps and of the enemy. He has the
compasses set to scale, to mark off some
seventeen to twenty miles, which means from
twenty-two to twenty-five miles of road, taking
into account the windings. To and fro he
twists and turns the compasses like lightning
and decides in an instant the marches for each
column to arrive at the desired point, all timed
exactly to the very day and hour with an astonishing
certainty and precision. He calls out his
instructions in half a dozen words or so, sharply
snapped out, for Berthier, who all the time is
standing near, bending down at Napoleon’s
shoulder, notebook and pencil in hand, to take
down. Old Berthier has a veritable instinct
for understanding what the Emperor means.
He can interpret the smallest grunt Napoleon
makes. He can spin out three or four broken
ejaculations into detailed orders for an Army
Corps, all worked out with absolute clearness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
in beautiful language. It is amazing how he
does it, but he does do it. A staff officer, or
else Bacler d’Albe, the Imperial Military Cartographer,
the officer in charge of the maps, it
may be, is all the while also kneeling by the
pin-box, and has the pins of the right colour
out and stuck in the maps as fast as the Emperor
wants them. The instant the Emperor is satisfied,
Berthier is off, and with the secretaries
at work in his own quarters drafting the orders.
Then, before you know well where you are, a
dozen <i lang="fr">estafettes</i> are galloping all over the
country with the orders—in the case of a very
important order sometimes three or four staff
officers each take a copy, to ride by different
routes so as to minimise the risk of delay or
capture. That is the working of Berthier’s
system, and there is not often a miscarriage or
serious hitch in the delivery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHALL SOULT</div>

<p>And mark Soult, the coming man of the Marshals
when he gets his chance; a wary old
dog-fox for an enemy to tackle. A sergeant
of infantry in the old “Royal Regiment”
of former days, the old 13th of the Line,
then a drill-instructor of Volunteers, now he is
at the head of the Army at Boulogne for the
descent on England. Hardly even the Emperor
knows more about tactics than Soult. Note how
self-possessed and masterful he looks, so cold
and impassive of demeanour. Those eyes that
seem to pierce through you, those clear-cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
aquiline features, that face like a mask of bronze,
show the character of the man. You wouldn’t
think though, to see his fine soldier-like figure
as he stands there, a warrior born to look at,
that Soult is not only lame from a fall from his
horse years ago, but has limped from his birth,
from a club-foot.</p>

<p>That bald-headed marshal over there is
Marshal Davout, a dashing subaltern of Dragoons
once in the Old Royal Army. A fine
tactician for a hot place is Davout; and when
the fight has been won, no leader so harsh and
pitiless to the vanquished enemy. He wears
spectacles on service: he can hardly see ten
yards in front of his big nose. The ladies are
very fond of Davout; he waltzes so nicely.</p>

<p>And that other there is Marshal Ney; “the
Indefatigable” is the Army’s name for him. He
never spares himself, nor the enemy, on the
battlefield; but after the last shot there is no
more generous victor than Marshal Ney. For
sheer dogged pluck against odds, for simply
marvellous intrepidity, the world cannot match
Ney. Stalwart and square-shouldered, he carries
himself with all the jaunty assurance of manner
you would expect in perhaps the most dashing
leader of hussars the Army of France has known.
He is an Alsatian, born by the Rhine; a pleasant-faced
man, with frank grey eyes, curly red hair
over a broad open forehead. “Red Michael”
is one of the soldiers’ names for Ney; and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
is not one of the Marshals for whom his men
would do more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES AWAIT NAPOLEON</div>

<p>Such, if it may be permitted to describe them
in this way, is something of what the Marshals
of Napoleon looked like on the day of the
Eagle presentation on the Field of Mars. All
eyes were turned on the Marshals as they stood
there beside Napoleon; a brilliant array of
soldierly figures in their red ostrich-plumed
cocked hats, richly laced uniforms, gleaming
brass-bound sword-scabbards and high jack-boots
with clanking brass spurs.</p>

<p>From the foot of the throne a grand staircase
led down to the parade ground, widening out
with a curving sweep to either side at the foot.
It terminated there with, flanking the lower
steps, two gilded statues, designed to represent,
the one, “France granting Peace,” the other,
“France making War.” From top to bottom
of the stairs and extending at the foot to right
and left along either side, stood in rows the
colonels of the regiments on parade, together
with the senior officers of the National Guard,
all awaiting the Emperor’s appearance on the
throne. Each bore the new Eagle standard to
be presented to his own corps. All were at
their posts as the appointed moment neared,
while at the same time Murat and his attendant
cavalcade of brilliantly bedecked horsemen
closed in and formed up in front, so as immediately
to face Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<p>On either hand of Murat were ranked the
massed bands of the Imperial Guard, flanked
by two solid phalanxes of drummers, each a
thousand strong. Near by these were drawn up
on horseback, on one side the officers of the Head
Quarters Staff at the War Office, on the other,
the staff officers of the army corps of the Marshals.</p>

<p>Napoleon and Josephine made their entry
into the Grand Pavilion heralded by a procession,
the bands of the Guard playing the Coronation
March. Then, to the accompaniment of
three successive shouts of “Vive l’Empereur!”
from the soldiers—the formal greeting to
Napoleon on parade, in accordance with Army
regulation—the Emperor seated himself on
the throne. He was in full Imperial garb, wearing
his Imperial mantle of rich crimson velvet
studded with golden bees, and the Imperial
crown, a golden laurel chaplet “after Charlemagne.”
In his right hand he bore the Imperial
sceptre, a tall silver-gilt wand with an eagle
surmounting it, also designed, as they said,
“after Charlemagne.”</p>

<p>Seating himself with Josephine at his side, in
her State robes and with a magnificent crown
of diamonds on her head, Napoleon gave the
order for the proceedings to begin.</p>

<p>Murat, as Governor of Paris, in immediate
command of the parade, raised his glittering
marshal’s bâton. The bands of the Guard
ceased playing abruptly. The next moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the two thousand infantry drums began to beat.
It was the appointed signal for the detachments
to advance and form up in front of the
throne.</p>

<p>At once, at the first roll of the drums, the
soldiers ranged round the ground began to
move.</p>

<p>Wheeling some, counter-marching others, here
rapidly doubling, there marking time—looking,
indeed, for the moment, at first, in the mass,
to the untrained eye of the non-military spectator
like a swarming ant-heap in motion and
inextricably intermingled—like magic all suddenly
appeared in order, a series of columns, the
heads of which, arrayed at regular intervals,
were in unison converging concentrically towards
the foot of the grand staircase in front
of the throne. A dozen paces in rear of where
Murat stood all halted as one man. There was
a quick movement of bayonets as arms were
shouldered; the action making a glint of flashing
steel in spite of the dull grey light overhead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON FACES THE PARADE</div>

<p>Every sound was hushed as Napoleon rose to
his feet. He faced the wide-spreading multitude
and gazed silently over them for a moment;
standing well forward where all might see him.
Then he addressed the parade in strong vibrant
tones which rang out clear and resonant over
the whole assembly like a trumpet-note. In
words that seemed to thrill with intensified
energy he called on the soldiers before him, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
behalf of themselves and their absent comrades,
to take the oath of devotion to the Eagles.</p>

<p>“Soldiers!” he began, his right arm outstretched
with an impassioned gesture towards
the Eagles, whose bearers held them stiffly
erect, all glancing and gleaming like polished
gold, the bright-hued silken flags unfurled,
“behold your standards! These Eagles to you
shall ever be your rallying-point. Wherever
your Emperor shall deem it needful for the defence
of his throne and his people, there shall they be
seen!”</p>

<p>He paused. Then raising his right hand in
the air with a swift strenuous movement Napoleon
pronounced the oath:</p>

<p>“You swear to sacrifice your lives in their
defence: to maintain them by your courage
ever in the path of Victory! You swear it?”</p>

<p>The vast gathering stood as though spellbound.
For one instant all remained motionless
and silent, held down as it were by overmastering
emotion.</p>

<p>Then, all together, with one accord, the soldiers
found their voices. With a thundering shout
that seemed to shake the air, the Army made
its response, answering back in one deep chorus:</p>

<div class="sidenote">“WE SWEAR IT! WE SWEAR IT!”</div>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Nous le jurons!</i>”—“We swear it!”</p>

<p>One and all enthusiastically re-echoed the
words; while the colonels excitedly brandished
and waved aloft the Eagles. In a frenzy of
martial ardour the entire assembly, at the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of their voices, again and again declaimed,
“We swear it! We swear it!” A wild prolonged
outburst of cheering followed, and
exuberant shouts of “Vive l’Empereur!”</p>

<p>Before the cheering had abated, the drums
broke in again. The sharp clash and rattle
recalled all to order instantly. Again a dead
silence fell over the great host, standing now
with recovered arms.</p>

<p>Up once more went Murat’s marshal’s bâton.
The next moment the dense-set columns were
standing stock-still like rows of statues, with
arms at the shoulder.</p>

<p>Napoleon resumed his seat on the throne, and
as he did so yet once more a wave of enthusiasm
swept over the vast array. Redoubled shouts of
“Vive l’Empereur!” burst wildly forth, the
soldiers pulling off their hats or helmets, and
hoisting them on the points of their bayonets,
excitedly waving them, while they shouted
themselves breathless.</p>

<p>Again the drums rolled, and again order was
restored. And now the supreme act of the
drama opened—the formal presentation of each
Eagle to its own regimental deputation.</p>

<p>Forthwith the wide-fronted columns, breaking
swiftly into quarter-column formation, began to
move, section by section, in turn. Rapidly,
and, as it almost seemed, automatically, they
resumed their first formation, extending round
the Field of Mars on three sides. From front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to rear the quarter-columns took up a full mile
and three-quarters. Ranked in close order, the
long-drawn-out array of troops on that set off,
to a stately march from the bands of the Guard,
to pass along the front of the Military School,
before the flanking pavilion, and galleries and
stands. So, in due course, all in turn came
opposite to the foot of the great stairway ascending
to the throne.</p>

<p>Each section, as it came in front of the steps,
made a pause. The Colonels at the same
moment were passing in file before Napoleon.
Each in turn inclined the Eagle that he bore towards
the Emperor. He held the staff at an
angle of forty-five degrees—the regulation method
of salute, in accordance with an Imperial order
issued in the previous July, when the adoption
of the Eagle as the Army standard was first
announced. Napoleon on his side, with his
ungloved right hand, just touched each Eagle.
The Colonels, then, saluting, turned, one after the
other, to descend the stairs. At the foot of the
stairway each delivered over the Eagle to the
standard-bearer of his regiment, who, together
with the deputation, was at the spot to receive it.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ONLY EXISTING NAVAL EAGLE</div>

<p>With the Eagles in their charge the regimental
parties moved on. Passing in front of the
stands and pavilions beyond, all wheeled there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to pass again round the arena of the Field of
Mars, until they had reached their former
stations, and halted, all ranged in the order in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
which they had taken post at their first
arrival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLE OF THE IRISH LEGION</div>

<p>There remained after that the grand <i lang="fr">finale</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
The March Past of the Eagle detachments before
Napoleon now came on, designed as the consummation
of the day’s doings.</p>

<p>In connection with that, however, there was
an unfortunate incident. On the Field of Mars
were displayed also the old Army colours of the
Consulate, which, as has been said, had been
brought to Paris at the order of the War Minister
by the regimental deputations. Paraded together
with the new Eagles they helped to
render the scene the more striking; but their
presence led to an unforeseen complication,
and in the end a deplorable <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>.</p>

<p>The standard-bearers who had received the
Eagles were each, in addition, still carrying the
old regimental flag. They had to carry both.
No instructions had been given out—by oversight,
most probably—as to the giving up of the
old flags, or what was to be done with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALL DID NOT WANT THE EAGLES</div>

<p>It may have been that Napoleon desired that
the standards of the Consulate and the Eagles
of the Empire should be displayed together
on that day. None knew better than he the
deep attachment of the older men in the ranks
for their former battle-flags. Some of the old
soldiers, indeed, even there on the Field of Mars,
as we are told, were unable to restrain their
feelings at the idea of having to part that day
from their old colours. “More than one tear
was shed,” relates an officer, “amidst all the
cheering and shouts of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Enthusiastically as most of the soldiers might
welcome the new Eagles in the presence of the
Emperor, all did not desire to part with colours
which had led through the battle-smoke on many
a victorious field of the past, even in exchange
for the glittering “Cou-cous,” as barrack-room
slang had already dubbed Napoleon’s Eagles,
giving them in advance a soldier’s nickname
that stuck to them as long as the Army of the
Empire lasted.</p>

<p>Both sets of standards were carried in the
march past, which proceeded without incident
to a certain point.</p>

<p>It was an effective display of the lusty manhood
of France, of the pick of the Grand Army in its
prime; not yet made <i lang="fr">chair au canon</i> to gratify
the ambition of one man. A curious commingling,
too, of fighting costumes did the review
present for the general spectators; those of
yesterday side by side with those of the coming
time. Three-fourths of the soldiers went by
wearing the stiff Republican garb of the expiring
<i lang="fr">régime</i>, as adopted hastily at the outset of the
Revolution: the long-skirted coat, cut after the
old Royal Army fashion, but blue in colour
instead of white, and with white lapels and
turn-backs; long-flapped white waistcoats,
white breeches, and high black-cloth gaiters
above the knee, such as their ancestors had worn
in the days of Marshal Saxe; the old-style big
cocked hat, worn cross-wise, or “en bataille,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
as the soldiers called it, with a flaunting tricolor
cockade in front. The new Napoleonic style
was represented by the Imperial Guard and
Oudinot’s Grenadier Division from Arras and
the Light Infantry battalions, whose turn out
in smartly cut coatees faced with red and green,
with the tall broad-topped shakos pictures of
the time make us familiar with as the normal
presentment of the soldiers of the Empire,
attracted special attention.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>During the March Past, Frimaire suddenly
reasserted itself, and brought about the regrettable
incident that was to wind up the day.</p>

<p>The parade was three parts through, when, all
of a sudden, a tremendous downpour of cold
rain set in, discomfiting and scattering all
who were looking on. With the drenching
effect of a shower-bath the rain commenced to
pour down in torrents, causing an immediate
stampede among the general public. The rearmost
columns of the soldiers had to pass before
empty benches, tramping along stolidly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the mud, “splashing ankle-deep through a sea
of mud,” as an officer put it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SPECTATORS DISAPPEAR</div>

<p>The spectators one and all disappeared. The
immense crowd of sightseers left the benches on
the embankment round the Champ de Mars,
and fled home <i lang="fr">en masse</i>. The seat-holders on
the open stands in front of the Ecole Militaire
scurried off in like manner. The occupants of
the pavilions and galleries, half drowned by the
water that streamed down on them through the
awnings, quitted their places in haste to seek
shelter within the building. The downpour
saturated the canopy of the Imperial Pavilion
and dripped through. It compelled Josephine
to get up from her throne and hurry indoors.
The Princesses promptly followed the Empress’s
example, all except one—Napoleon’s youngest
sister, Caroline Murat. Caroline sat the March
Past out to the end, together, of course, with
Napoleon himself and the Marshals, and those
Court officials who had to stay where they were.
Soaked through, she smilingly remarked that
she was “accustoming herself to endure the
inconveniences inseparable from a throne!”</p>

<p>Then, at the close of the review, came the
<i lang="fr">contretemps</i>.</p>

<p>After the last Eagle had gone past the throne,
when Napoleon had left on his way back to the
Tuileries, as the troops were moving off the
ground to return to their quarters, unanticipated
trouble suddenly arose in connection with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
the old flags. What happened may best,
perhaps, be described in the words of an eye-witness,
a General present on the Field of Mars,
Baron Thiébault:</p>

<p>“Immediately after the Emperor had gone
and the seats all round were empty, finding it
tiresome to be loaded with the double set of
standards, all the more so, no doubt, as it was
raining, the standard-bearers apparently could
think of nothing better than to rid themselves
of the superseded flags. They began everywhere
to throw them down, that is, to drop them where
they stood in the mud. There they were trampled
under foot by the soldiers as they passed
along on their way back to quarters.”</p>

<p>The outrage scandalised the older soldiers,
and very nearly brought about a mutiny among
some of them.</p>

<p>“Indignant,” to continue in General Thiébault’s
words, “at such an outrage to national
emblems which the Army had been honouring
and defending for thirteen years past, many of
the men in the regiments began to grumble and
make angry protestations. Presently oaths and
violent imprecations burst out on all sides;
and then some of the grenadiers became mutinous
and defiant. They declared that they would
go back, regardless of the consequences, and
forcibly recover possession of the old colours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SITUATION JUST SAVED</div>

<p>The situation speedily became so threatening
that General Thiébault hastened off to warn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Murat of what was happening. As he went he
came across one of the adjutants of the Commandant
of the Military School. On the spur
of the moment he gave him orders to get
together what men he could of the party who
had been keeping the parade ground. Of
these Thiébault took personal charge and sent
them round at once to collect the thrown-down
colours and carry them inside the Ecole
Militaire.</p>

<p>Apparently that satisfied the soldiers—anxious,
most of them, to get out of the wet as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>General Thiébault tried after that to find
Murat, intending to report to him; but Murat
had by then left the Field of Mars. In the end
the General decided, as perhaps the wisest
course, to refrain from saying anything; not
to take official notice of what had happened.
After all he was not on duty at the parade; he
was only in Paris as an invited guest at the
Coronation festivities. Nobody, as a fact, said
a word of the affair. By the authorities all
reference to it seems purposely to have been
hushed up. Not a hint of anything of the sort
appeared in the <i lang="fr">Moniteur</i>, which published a
fairly full report of the day’s proceedings; not
a word in any of the other Parisian papers.</p>

<p>For the soldiers a dinner of double rations at
the Emperor’s expense wound up the Day of the
Eagles; for the great personages there was “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
banquet at the Tuileries, at which the Pope and
the Emperor sat side by side at the same table,
arrayed in their Pontifical and Imperial insignia
and waited upon by the Grand Officers of the
Crown.” Afterwards, without delaying in the
capital, the deputations set off on their return
to rejoin their regiments. Their arrival at their
various destinations was celebrated everywhere,
by Imperial order, by a full-dress parade and
State reception of the Eagle by each corps;
the occasion being further treated as a fête-day
and opportunity for a general carousal in
camp or garrison. At Boulogne the regiments
of the “Army of England” took over their
Eagles at a grand review on December 23,
Marshal Soult presiding over the ceremony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLOSE OF THE DAY</div>

<p>The old standards of the Consulate, some
bearing on them the battle-scars of Marengo and
Hohenlinden, remained where General Thiébault’s
assistants had left them stacked, leaning
up against the wall in one of the corridors of
the Military School, until they were carted off
in artillery tumbrils to the central dépôt at
Vincennes. There, on New Year’s Day of 1805,
they were officially made away with; burned
to ashes in the presence of an ordnance department
official told off to certify to their complete
destruction. That was the authorised method
in France of disposing of the standards of a
discredited <i lang="fr">régime</i>; but all the same it was
a hard fate for national emblems that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
waved victoriously over so many a hard-fought
field.</p>

<p>Such were the principal scenes and incidents
of the Day of the Field of Mars when Napoleon
presented the Eagles of the Empire to the
Soldiers of the Grand Army.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="toclink_60"><span class="smcap">Under Fire with Marshal Ney</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Eagles made their <i lang="fr">début</i> on the battlefield
amid a blaze of glory. Within a twelvemonth
of the Field of Mars they had swooped irresistibly
across half the Continent, leading forward
victoriously through the cannon-smoke in combat
after combat, to achieve the crowning
triumphs of Ulm and Austerlitz. Within the
twelvemonth they witnessed the overwhelming
defeat of more than 200,000 foes, the capture
of 500 cannon, while 120 standards had been
paraded before them as spoils of victory.</p>

<p>In the first fortnight of September 1805,
Austria and Russia, as the protagonists in
Pitt’s great European Coalition against Napoleon,
declared war on France, and an army of
80,000 Austrians traversed Bavaria in hot
haste, to take post at Ulm by the Danube,
on the frontiers of Würtemberg. There they
proposed to hold Napoleon in check, until their
Russian allies, whose advance by forced marches
through Poland had already begun, could join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
hands with them. After that they would press
forward in resistless force to cross the Rhine
and invade France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S OPENING MOVE</div>

<p>But Napoleon was beforehand with them from
the outset. Within twenty-four hours of the
ultimatum reaching his hands he had made
the opening move in the campaign: the lion,
whose skin had been sold, had crouched for
the fatal spring.</p>

<p>General Mack, the Austrian Commander-in-chief,
entered Bavaria on September 8. On
September 1 Napoleon’s “Army of the Ocean”
had struck its tents in Boulogne camp and
started on its way, with plans laid that ensured
Mack’s overthrow. A hundred and eighty thousand
soldiers were hastening along every high-road
through Hanover, Holland, and Flanders,
and in eastern France, towards the great plain
of central Bavaria, to deal the Austrians the
heaviest and most resounding blow ever yet
dealt to a modern army.</p>

<p>Napoleon, screening his movement by means
of Murat’s cavalry, sent ahead on a wide front
to occupy the attention of the Austrian outposts,
made a bold sweep right round Mack’s
right flank. Before the Austrian general had
any suspicion that there was a single Frenchman
on that side of him, the entire French army had
passed the Danube in his rear, and had blocked
the great highway from Vienna. Napoleon at
the first move had cut the Austrian line of communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
with their base. He had barred
the only route by which the Russians could
approach to Mack’s assistance.</p>

<p>That done, swiftly and successfully, while
Mack, startled and utterly staggered at the
sudden appearance of the enemy in his rear,
was hurriedly facing about in confusion, to try
to hold his ground, Napoleon struck at him
hard. He hurled attack after attack in force
on the Austrian flanking divisions, on both
wings of Mack’s army, and broke them up.
Taking thousands of prisoners and many guns,
he drove the wreck, a disorganised mass of
scared and helpless battalions, in rout to the
walls of Ulm itself. Penned in there, ringed
round by 100,000 French bayonets, with the
French artillery pouring shot and shell into
the doomed fortress from commanding heights
within short range, General Mack, left now
with barely 30,000 men, after a despairing
interview with Napoleon, was terrorised into
immediate surrender at discretion.</p>

<p>Amid such scenes did the Eagles of the Field
of Mars undergo their baptism of fire. Ever
in the forefront under fire, brilliantly, time and
again, did those who bore them do their duty.</p>

<p>It was round the Eagles of Marshal Ney’s
corps, “the Fighting Sixth,” that the fiercest
contests of the campaign centred; and on every
occasion they gained honour.</p>

<p>In the sharp brush at the bridge across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
Danube at Reisenburg, near the small town of
Günsburg, on October 8, one of the opening
encounters of the campaign, the Eagle of the
59th of the Line showed the way to victory. The
Austrians, whom Ney surprised on the south
side or right bank, retreating as the French
approached, had partially broken down the
bridge before Ney’s men could reach the place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE BRIDGE OF GÜNSBURG</div>

<p>The Danube flows wide and deep at Reisenburg,
and there was no other means of getting
over.</p>

<p>Ney had explicit orders from Napoleon to
cross over and occupy Günsburg, and to hold
the river passage. As the 59th, who led the
attack, got to the bridge, a long and narrow
wooden structure, the Austrian sappers were
hard at work destroying it; covered by a rearguard
brigade of infantry and artillery. The
planking had been ripped away, but most of the
bridge framework and supporting beams still
stood. The 59th came up and opened fire,
compelling the sappers to withdraw. Then a
hasty effort was made by the pioneers of the
regiment under fire to repair part of the bridge.
They made a way across with planks wide
enough for a few men to scramble over together.
“In places only one man could get across at a
time.”</p>

<p>At once the 59th rushed forward cheering,
but the concentrated Austrian fire from the
other side was too hot to face. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
beaten back three times, the dead and wounded
falling into the rushing stream below. But
were they not the 59th? No other of the regiments
following them in rear should have
the honour of being the first to make the passage!
The Eagle-bearer of the 59th, weaving the Eagle
aloft, headed a fourth attack; with Colonel
Gerard Lacuée, the colonel of the regiment,
a distinguished officer and an Honorary A.D.C.
to the Emperor, beside him. The two led out
in front, regardless of the storm of bullets round
them. Colonel Lacuée fell mortally wounded.
An officer ran forward and carried the Colonel
back to die on the river-bank, but the Eagle-bearer
went on. “Soldiers,” the brave fellow
stopped for an instant to turn round and shout
back to his comrades, “your Eagle goes forward!
I shall carry it across alone!” The men of the
59th, thrown into a frenzy at the sight of their
Eagle’s peril, rallied instantly to follow. The
four leading companies held on bravely and got
across. Then they charged the Austrians at
the point of the bayonet and drove them back
into the village. That, though, was not all.
Fresh Austrians had turned back to help their
rearguard troops. Firing from the river-bank
on either side of the village, for a time they
stopped the other French regiments from crossing
the bridge after the 59th. Austrian dragoons
and infantry at the same time charged the
gallant regiment, entirely isolated now on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
side of the river. But they could not break the
59th. Forming square, the two battalions, with
their Eagles held on high as rallying-centres,
kept a host of foes at bay. Three fierce Austrian
charges did they beat off—and then help
arrived. A second regiment, the 50th, had by
then managed to get across the bridge. The
two regiments maintained themselves there all
the afternoon until nightfall and then bivouacked
on the ground they had won until morning,
“passing an anxious time, under arms, unable
to light a fire. Fortunately, in the dark the
Austrians did not realise our small numbers.
They were more anxious to cover their own
retreat.” Before daylight the Austrians fell
back and the passage of the Danube was won.</p>

<p>There was another morning’s work on
October 11.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES AT HASLACH</div>

<p>At Haslach, on the north bank of the Danube,
not far from Ulm, a brigade of Dupont’s Division
of Ney’s corps, advancing on that side on its
own account, was suddenly set on by five times
its number of Austrians. The brigade was made
up of three regiments: the 9me Légère (or
9th Light Infantry), the 32nd, and the 69th. They
stumbled, as it were, suddenly on the Austrians,
whereupon General Dupont, who was riding
with the brigade, on the opposite side of the
river from the rest of his troops, “judging that
if he fell back it would betray his weakness,”
made a dash at the enemy. His daring deceived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
the Austrians, who believed that he was the
advanced guard of a large force close behind.
They held back at first and awaited attack.
Throwing the 32nd into Haslach to hold the
village, Dupont boldly charged with the two
other regiments, and at the first onset made
1,500 prisoners, numbers equal to a quarter of
his total force. The Austrians, however, rallied
and returned to the fight. They brought up
reinforcements and entrenched themselves in
the village of Jüningen, near by, where again
Dupont attacked them. Five times did the
9th Light Infantry take and retake Jüningen
at the point of the bayonet, their two battalion
Eagles heading the attack each time. No fewer
than six officers, bearing the Eagles in turn, fell
in the fight. “Ces corps ne devaient étonner
de rien,” commented Napoleon in praising
Dupont and his men.</p>

<p>At Elchingen, a village in the immediate
neighbourhood of Ulm, the scene of the brilliant
victory by which Marshal Ney won his title of
Due d’Elchingen, the Eagles of two regiments
won distinction, through the individual heroism
of the officers who, holding them on high,—“En
haut l’Aigle!” was the charging cry—led
the onset that stormed the place.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES STORM ELCHINGEN</div>

<p>Ney headed the 6th Light Infantry personally,
“in full uniform and ablaze with decorations,
offering a splendid target to the enemy.” Ney
led the 6th with the Eagle of the First Battalion
carried close at his side. Fifteen thousand
Austrians with forty guns held Elchingen, and the
post is described as being “one of the strongest
positions that could be imagined.” The village
itself, a large place, consisted of “successive piles
of stone houses, intersected at right angles by
streets, rising in the form of an amphitheatre
from the banks of the Danube to a large convent
which crowns the summit of the ascent. All the
exposed points on heights were lined with
artillery; all the windows filled with musketeers.”
The village was on the north bank, and
the river had to be crossed to get to it.</p>

<p>First the gallant 6th Light Infantry stormed
the bridge. It had been partly destroyed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
the Austrians on the day before, and its tottering
arches were now swept by cannon-balls,
plunging down from batteries on the heights in
rear, and a tornado of bullets from sharpshooters
in the houses near the river-side. Fighting their
way forward step by step, the 6me Légère went
on. Their Eagle headed the advance. Its
bearer was wounded, but he proudly brandished
on high the standard; its silken flag torn to
tatters by bullets, and with one wing of the
Eagle broken by a shot. With the 6th fought
the 69th of the Line. The two regiments forced
their way along the steep crooked main street
up hill, fired down on furiously meanwhile
from the windows. Parties of men at times
entered the houses at the sides and fought the
enemy inside bayonet to bayonet, from floor
to floor. The 6th and the 69th pressed forward,
broke down the enemy’s resistance, and carried
Elchingen. The Austrians finally, after a gallant
attempt to hold out in the convent on the
hilltop, abandoned it as fresh French troops
came up from across the river.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, when the fight was over,
Napoleon, with the Imperial staff round him,
publicly congratulated Marshal Ney (he named
him later “Duc D’Elchingen”) in the presence
of the 6th Light Infantry and the 69th, specially
paraded at the spot for the occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES AT ULM</div>

<p>The Eagles of Ney, again, were foremost at
the winning of the final fight at Ulm. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
led the furious onrush that stormed the steep
heights of Michelsberg and Les Tuileries, the
key of the last Austrian position. Thence Napoleon
looked down directly into the fortress; and
within an hour of Ney’s brilliant final feat the
French shells, from batteries, quickly galloped up
to the heights, were bursting in Ulm, carrying
terror and death into every quarter of the city.</p>

<p>On that came the surrender of General Mack.
The curtain next rises on the intensely dramatic
Fifth Act of the tragedy, the march out of the
Austrians to lay down their arms.</p>

<p>In that display the Eagles had their allotted
place. Before them, brought forward and prominently
paraded, each Eagle in advance of its
own corps in line, with the whole Grand Army
ranged in battle order as spectators of the
scene, the standards of the vanquished foe defiled
out of the gates of Ulm, and were laid down on
the ground in formal token of surrender.</p>

<p>Napoleon proved himself at Ulm a born
stage-manager.</p>

<p>Hardly ever before, never in modern war,
had such a spectacle been witnessed as that
presented on that chill and cheerless October
Sunday forenoon, October 20, 1805, in the
heart of central Germany, beside the banks of
the rushing Danube, roaring past, a yellow
foaming torrent after weeks of autumn rain,
amid pine-clad summits extending far and wide
on either hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>Along the lower slopes of the high ground to
the north and east of Ulm, drawn up in lines
and columns over a wide semi-circle, stood the
victorious army; massed round, as it were, in
a vast amphitheatre. They formed up by
army corps, and took post grim and silent,
drawn up in battle array, with muskets loaded
and bayonets fixed. The Cavalry with sabres
drawn were on one side; the Infantry on the
other, facing them and leaving a space between,
along which the Austrians were to pass. Fifty
loaded cannon, in line along one ridge, pointed
down on the city. In front, towards the river,
there rose a small knoll, an outlying spur of
rock. On that Napoleon took his station
beside a blazing watchfire which marked the
spot from far. Accompanying him were most
of the marshals and the assembled Etat-Major
of the Grand Army, a numerous and brilliant
gathering. Immediately in rear stood massed
the 10,000 men of the Imperial Guard.</p>

<p>Two army corps, a little way from the rest,
had a special post of honour. They were drawn
up at the end of the wide semi-circle of the main
army nearest the Augsburg gate of Ulm; immediately
where the defilading column of captives
would present themselves before passing
Napoleon to lay down their arms and standards.
The two corps were: that on the right, Ney’s,
the Sixth Army Corps, the heroes of the day <i lang="fr">par
excellence</i>; on the left, the Second Corps, Marmont’s,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
who had been doing notable work elsewhere
in the neighbourhood of Ulm. Ney, with
his personal staff beside him, was on horseback
in front of the centre of his corps; Marmont had
his post in like manner in front of his men. As
his personal reward for the leading part Ney
and the Sixth Corps had had in bringing about
the triumph, that marshal had the special honour
of being designated to superintend the surrender.</p>

<p>A few minutes before ten o’clock the French
drums began to beat, and the regimental bands
to play. Immediately after that the long-drawn-out
procession of sullen and woebegone-looking
Austrian captives began silently to
trail its way out of the Stuttgart gate of the
fortress. “Suddenly we saw an endless column
file out of the town and march up in front of
the Emperor, on the plain at the foot of a
mountain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MACK SURRENDERS HIS SWORD</div>

<p>General Mack himself headed it, wan-faced
and pale as the white uniform coat he wore,
his eyes filled with tears, his head bowed, a
pitiful and abject figure to behold. After him
followed eighteen Austrian generals—a surprising
number—most of them as wretched and
downcast-looking as their chief. “Behold,
Sire, the unfortunate Mack!” was the ill fated
leader’s address to Napoleon, as he formally
presented his sword. Napoleon, in a mood—as
well he might be—in that hour of unparalleled
triumph, to show courtesy to the fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
foe, desired Mack to keep his sword and remain
at his side. He said the same to the eighteen
other generals as, one by one, they came up in
turn to tender him their swords. He returned
each his sword and bade them all place themselves
near their chief. When all the swords
had been presented and returned, Napoleon made
the Austrian generals collectively a short harangue.
“Gentlemen,” he began, “war has its
chances! Often victorious, you must expect
sometimes to be vanquished!” He did not
really know, Napoleon went on, why they were
fighting. Their master had begun against him
an unjust war. “I want nothing on the Continent,”
said Napoleon in conclusion, “only ships,
colonies, and commerce!” It was on the day
before Trafalgar that these memorable words
were spoken. The Austrian generals stared at
Napoleon blankly, but not one uttered a word.
“They were all very dull; it was the Emperor
alone who kept up the conversation.” Then
they took their stand beside their conqueror
and looked on at the bitterly humiliating scene
of the defilade of their fellow soldiers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PARADE OF THE VANQUISHED</div>

<p>In an almost incessant throng the columns of
the Austrian army streamed by: white-clad
cuirassiers; hussars in red and blue and grey;
battery after battery of cocked-hatted, brown-garbed
artillerymen, riding with or on their
rumbling dull-yellow wheeled guns; battalion
after battalion of white-coated linesmen; dark-green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
coated jägers; Hungarian grenadiers,
and so on. Twenty-seven thousand officers and
men and sixty field-guns in all defiled past the
Eagles, proudly arrayed there above them, in
front of the serried lines of glittering French
bayonets along the hillsides. For five hours on
end the host of captives plodded on before the
rocky brow from which Napoleon surveyed the
spectacle; tramping by, their muskets without
bayonets and unloaded, their cartridge-boxes
emptied. In several regiments the men maintained
a fair semblance of discipline and military
order; but the ranks of all were sadly bedraggled-looking,
the white uniforms torn and soiled
and besmirched with powder-smoke, with many
of the men hatless, or limping from wounds, or
with bound-up heads, and their arms in bloodstained
slings. As had been ordered by Napoleon,
they carried with them their standards;
no fewer than forty silken battle-flags—for the
most part cased, but here and there was to be
seen one not furled, displaying, as though in
futile defiance, its flaunting yellow folds with the
double-headed Black Eagle.</p>

<p>As the Austrian linesmen came abreast of
where Napoleon stood, the pace of the men
slackened. Every eye was turned to look at
“him”; at the small grey-coated figure on
foot beside the watchfire, standing near the
crestfallen group of their own generals, a few
paces from the bright and brilliant-hued cavalcade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of French marshals and the staff. All
stared at Napoleon, gazing as if under a spell.
Then, in the midst of it all, this happened.
Suddenly, as they passed Napoleon, a shout rose
from among the ranks of the defeated army: “Es
lebe der Kaiser!” (“Long live the Emperor!”)
The cry burst forth with startling effect. It was
repeated, and then several men took it up. But
what did it mean? “Es lebe der Kaiser!” was
the national German greeting in salute to their
own Austrian sovereign as Head of the Empire,
to the Kaiser at Vienna, the Emperor of Germany.
Did the soldiers who first raised the cry
intend it for that, or to hail Napoleon, as his
own men did, with a “Vive l’Empereur!”? The
words bore the same meaning. Or did the men
fling the words at Napoleon in a sort of bravado,
as a show of defiance? Some of the Austrians
assuredly did mean them so; to relieve the
breaking strain, the terrible tension of the ordeal.
At least some of the French officers near Napoleon
took that view of it. “As they passed by,”
describes one, “the prisoners, seized with wonder,
with admiration, slowed down in their march
to gaze at their conqueror, and some cried out
‘Long live the Emperor!’ but no doubt under
very different emotions; some with evident
mortification.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIVING UP THE GUNS AND HORSES</div>

<p>From the presence of Napoleon the captive
army passed to the scene of the act of final
humiliation: to the place where, midway between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the lines of bayonets of the troops of
Ney and Marmont, they were to lay down their
colours and ground their arms.</p>

<p>The colours were first surrendered, a French
General, Andréossi, formerly Napoleon’s Ambassador
in London, receiving them, with half
a dozen staff officers and orderlies, who deposited
the flags one by one in two commissariat wagons
drawn up close by.</p>

<p>It was a moment of the deepest and keenest
anguish for proud and gallant soldiers. All
round them on the hillsides most of the French,
overcome by excitement over the unprecedented
and amazing spectacle, were by that time almost
beside themselves, rending the air with exulting
shouts and cheers. Under the cruel stress of
the ordeal, as the supreme moment came on,
the self-possession of some of the Austrians,
tried beyond endurance, gave way.</p>

<p>The men of the Cavalry and Artillery bore
themselves throughout with well-disciplined
steadiness. As they came to the appointed place
where groups of French cavalry troopers and
gunners, told off to take over their horses and
guns, were standing near the roadside awaiting
them, they dismounted at the word of command
from their own commanders and stood back.
With hardly a murmur from the ranks the
Austrian troopers unbuckled their swords and
carbines and pistols, and dropped them in heaps
at the places pointed out to them. With quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
dignity the officers relinquished their gold-embroidered
banners into the enemy’s hands.
In grim silence they saw the victors—who there
at any rate behaved with courtesy and soldierly
consideration for the feeling of the vanquished—step
forward to take possession of their horses
and their cannon. Many of the Austrians had
tears running down their cheeks; some stood
trembling with suppressed passion;—but all
preserved order and behaved with complete
decorum as became disciplined soldiers.</p>

<p>With others unfortunately, with some of the
infantry corps, it was otherwise. At the very
last, before arriving at the place where they
were to give up their weapons, a number of
the men in some of the marching regiments
broke down under the fearful strain of the moment
and lost their heads. In many regiments,
no doubt, the soldiers obeyed mechanically,
acting like men half stunned after a violent
shock; they did as they were told, and passively
grounded their arms to order. But in others
the final scene was attended by acts of wild
frenzy, pitiful to behold. In, as it were, a
paroxysm of exasperation at the disgrace that
had befallen them, the rank and file of these
broke out recklessly, and got at once beyond all
efforts of their officers to control. With one
accord they began smashing the locks and butts
of their muskets on the ground with savage
curses, flinging away their arms all round, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
stripping off their accoutrements and stamping
on them, trampling them down in the mud.
These, though, as has been said, were only some
of the men; and in certain regiments. The
majority of the Austrians bore themselves with
fortitude and calmness.</p>

<p>At the end of the afternoon the Imperial
Guard, headed by their Eagle and band, marched
into Ulm and through the city, as we are told,
“amid the shouts of the whole populace.”</p>

<p>So terminated the tragedy of Ulm, in the
presence of the Eagles on their first triumphant
battlefield.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ULM TROPHIES FOR PARIS</div>

<p>The spoils of the Eagles at all points, as announced
by Napoleon in the Ulm Bulletin of the
Grand Army, were 60,000 prisoners, 200 pieces
of cannon, and, in all, 90 flags. The 40
standards surrendered at Ulm itself Napoleon
sent to Paris forthwith—after a grand parade
of the trophies at Augsburg, in which ninety
sergeants of the Imperial Guard bore in procession
the Austrian flags. The Ulm trophies were
made an Imperial gift for the Senate. “It is a
homage,” wrote Napoleon, “which I and my
Army pay to the Sages of the Empire.” They
were the flags, it may be added, which were
displayed at the head of Napoleon’s coffin on the
occasion of his State funeral in 1840: they form
four-fifths of the trophies now grouped round
Napoleon’s tomb. Alone of the trophies of the
Ulm campaign, and also of the Austerlitz campaign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
which followed it, they escaped destruction
in the holocaust of Napoleon’s trophies that took
place at the Invalides in March 1814, on the
night of the surrender of Paris to the Allies.
How that came to pass will be told later.</p>

<p>There was a very interesting sequel to the
Ulm campaign for one of Ney’s regiments. A
brief but brilliant campaign in the Tyrol on
their own account followed for Ney’s men
immediately after Ulm.</p>

<p>Entering the Tyrol with two of his divisions,
Ney attacked and by brilliant tactics overthrew
the Tyrolese forces and Austrian regulars who
barred his way in a position among the mountains
deemed impregnable. The battalion Eagles of
the 69th gave the signal for the frontal attack
which stormed the enemy’s position. Guided
by chamois-hunters the soldiers with the Eagles
scaled the face of a precipitous line of crags
which overhung in rear the Austrian centre, by
inserting their bayonets into fissures in the
rocks and clinging to shrubs and creepers, their
havresacs tied round their heads as protection
from the stones that the Tyrolese above showered
down on them. At the top, driving in the defenders,
they held up the gleaming Eagles in the
sunlight on the brink of the precipice to the
marshal below, firing down on the Austrians at
the same time to demoralise their resistance and
clear the way for Ney’s main effort: “Les Aigles
du 69me plantées sur la cime des rochers servirent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
de signal à l’attacque de front que le Maréchal
Ney avait preparé.”</p>

<p>Innsbrück, the capital of the Tyrol, and the
head-quarters of the Austrian army corps
garrisoning the country, was the immediate
prize of the victory. It was there that this
incident took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO LOST FLAGS ARE FOUND</div>

<p>One of Ney’s regiments, the 76th, had fought
in the Tyrol six years before; in Masséna’s
campaign of 1799, in one of the battles of which—at
Senft in the Grisons, on August 22—two
of its battalions lost their colours. An
officer of the regiment, while visiting the
arsenal at Innsbrück after Ney’s capture of the
city, came across the two flags there, in tatters
from bullet-holes, hung up as trophies. He made
known his discovery, and the place was quickly
filled with the soldiers of the regiment, eager
to see the old flags. “They crowded round them
and kissed the fragments of their old colours,
with tears in their eyes.”</p>

<p>Ney had the flags removed at once. He restored
them to the custody of the regiment with
his own hand at a grand parade in the presence
of the rest of his army, which the marshal
attended with his staff, all in full uniform. The
old colours were received with an elaborate display
of military ceremonial. They were borne
along the lines while the regimental band played
a stately march, and the Eagles of both battalions
were formally dipped in salute to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>

<p>On receiving Ney’s report, Napoleon thought
fit to give the recovery of the flags a Bulletin
to itself. Relating how they had been lost in
battle, and the “affliction profonde” of the
regiment in consequence, he set forth how they
had been found and handed back by Marshal
Ney to the regiment “with an affecting solemnity
that drew tears from the eyes of both the old
soldiers and the young conscripts, proud of
having had their share in regaining them!”
“Le soldat Français,” concluded the Bulletin,
“a pour ses drapeaux un sentiment qui tient
de la tendresse; ils sont l’objet de son culte,
comme un présent reçu des mains d’une mère.”
A medal was specially struck to commemorate
the event; and Napoleon, in addition, specially
commissioned an artist, Meynier, to paint a
picture for him of Marshal Ney presenting the
recovered colours to the regiment. The painting
is now in one of the galleries of Versailles.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_80"><span class="smcap">The Midnight Battle by the Danube</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">TRAPPED BY NAPOLEON’S FAULT</div>

<p>A startling and dramatic episode of the first
campaign of the Eagles comes next. It took
place during the second stage of the war; in
the midst of Napoleon’s impetuous advance on
Vienna down the Danube valley after Ulm.
Intent on dealing a shattering blow at the advanced
army corps of the Russians, which had
reached Lower Austria and was making an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
effort to cover the capital, Napoleon made a
false move, and left one of the headmost French
divisions in an exposed position, temporarily
isolated. It got trapped by the Russians at
Dürrenstein, or Dirnstein, on the north side of
the Danube, to the west of and about seventy
miles up the river from Vienna; and was all
but annihilated. There was nearly twenty
hours of continuous fighting, including a night
battle of the fiercest and most desperate character
in which three Eagles were temporarily lost;
fortunately to be recovered later among the dead
on the battlefield.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<p>It was on an extemporised corps, specially
placed under the command of Marshal Mortier,
that the blow fell.</p>

<figure id="i_82" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 40em;">
  <img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="3147" height="2775" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption">
    <p>NAPOLEON’S CONCENTRATION IN REAR OF ULM</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While Napoleon and the Grand Army in force
advanced along the south, or right, bank of the
Danube, Mortier had been detached across the
river to hold in check any attempt to interfere
with the main operations from the Bohemian
side. A body of Austrian cavalry, under the
Archduke Ferdinand, had managed to cut their
way through from Ulm at one point just before
the closing of the net round General Mack.
With the aid of the local militia levies these
might prove troublesome on the line of communications.
To deal with them, three divisions,
drawn from as many corps, were amalgamated
as Mortier’s special corps, which numbered in
all between twenty and twenty-five thousand
men: Gazan’s division, lent by Marshal Lannes;
Dupont’s, lent by Ney; Dumonceau’s, lent by
Marmont. To keep Mortier in touch with the
main body of the army, and that he might be
reinforced in emergency, a flotilla of Danube
craft was at the same time improvised, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
placed in charge of the Seamen of the Guard,
a battalion of whom had accompanied Napoleon
for the campaign. The flotilla was to keep pace
with Mortier and link him with Napoleon.
Mortier crossed at Linz and moved forward;
his three divisions each a day’s march apart,
for convenience of provisioning. He marched
so fast, however, that he outstripped the connecting
boats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DANUBE FLOTILLA STOPPED</div>

<p>At the moment the fighting opened, the flotilla
was miles in rear. It had been stopped and its
progress blocked near Moelkt, unable in the
swollen state of the Danube to pass the dangerous
Strudel, or whirlpool, there, raging just then,
after the heavy autumn rains, with the force of
a swirling maelstrom. The flooded river had
made it extremely difficult work all the way,
even for the picked Seamen of the Guard, to
navigate with safety the assortment of boats
and timber rafts, clumsy structures of logs and
spars lashed together, 160 feet long each, and
planked over, with cabins on the planks, which
composed the flotilla. On them, together with
a quantity of spare stores and ammunition for
the army, convalescents and footsore men of
various regiments were being carried, who, it
was intended, would thus be on the spot to
reinforce Mortier first of all in case of danger.</p>

<p>Immediately after passing Dürrenstein, the
leading division, General Gazan’s, numbering
some 6,000 men, unexpectedly stumbled across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
part of the Russian rearguard. All unknown to
Mortier, the Russian army corps which had been
entrenched in front of Vienna had abandoned
its position and had hastily withdrawn north
of the river, crossing a short distance from
Dürrenstein.</p>

<p>Mortier, after clearing a narrow and difficult
pass on the eastern side of Dürrenstein, with
steep and rocky hills on one hand and the Danube
on the other, first learned of the presence of
the enemy by catching sight of the smoke of the
burning bridge of Krems, which the Russians
had set fire to after passing over. Then he
suddenly found his further advance barred by
troops with guns, who rapidly formed up across
his path. The Russians took up a formidable-looking
position, but the marshal decided to
attack without waiting for Dupont to come up
with the Second Division, or for the flotilla; both
miles in rear. The sight of the burning bridge and
the apparent haste of the enemy to get across
the river, it would seem, misled Mortier into
thinking that the Russians had been in action
with Napoleon, and were in flight, trying
to escape. He went at them without pausing
to reconnoitre. He assumed that they were
only making a show of defence. The troops
before him he would sweep aside easily. Then
he would press on and complete the rout of the
rest of the Russians, whom he took to be retreating
in confusion, screened by the force he saw,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
across his front. Confident of easy success,
Mortier entered into the fight then and there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SURPRISE FOR THE MARSHAL</div>

<p>The sudden rencontre, as has been said, was a
surprise for the marshal. Half an hour previously
a battle had been almost the last thing
in Mortier’s thoughts. His guns were on board
a number of river boats which were being
drifted downstream abreast of the troops, the
artillery horses being led with the marching
columns along the bank. The boats had been
requisitioned a few miles back, so as to enable
the troops to get on faster over the rough stretch
of road through the Pass of Dürrenstein. The
guns were hastily disembarked and raced forward
into the firing line in order to stop a forward
movement that the Russians, who promptly
took advantage of the opportunity offered by
Mortier being apparently without artillery,
began by making.</p>

<p>The Russians came on and quickly increased
in numbers, to Marshal Mortier’s further surprise.
Were those beaten troops in full flight?
They began to swarm down to meet the French;
heading for the guns as these were being brought
forward. The fight rapidly became general, and
charge after charge was made by the Russians
to carry Mortier’s guns. They captured them,
but were then beaten back and the guns recaptured.
Twice were the guns taken and retaken.
The two French regiments nearest the
guns, the 100th and 103rd, defended them with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
brilliant courage, their four battalion Eagles
conspicuous in the forefront and repeatedly the
centre of desperate fighting, as the Russians
essayed again and again at the point of the
bayonet to make prize of the gleaming emblems.</p>

<p>But more and more Russians kept joining in,
and after four hours of very severe fighting
the marshal began to get anxious. He had
gained ground towards Krems, and had made
some 1,500 prisoners; but every foot of the
way had been stubbornly contested, and his
losses had been serious.</p>

<p>Mortier after that left the troops, and with an
aide de camp galloped back through the pass
in order to hasten up Dupont. But the Second
Division was still at a distance. Dupont’s men
were still a long way beyond Dürrenstein and
could not arrive for some time yet. Mortier
could only tell them not to lose a moment, and
then retrace his own steps. On his way back,
to his amazement, he came upon a second Russian
column in great strength in the act of debouching
from a side pass and entering Dürrenstein. It
had come round by a track among the hills on
the north to take Gazan’s division in rear, and
interpose between it and Dupont’s reinforcing
troops. At considerable personal risk the marshal
managed to evade discovery by the Russians.
By following a devious by-path he at
length got back to where Gazan’s division was;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
as before, in hot action and slowly forcing the
Russians back.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOO LATE TO CLEAR THE PASS</div>

<p>Mortier stopped the advance at once. He
faced his troops about, and, while keeping off
his original enemy, retreated; closing his
columns and rushing all back as fast as possible
to repass the defile of Dürrenstein and confront
the new enemy on the further side, in a position
he might hold until Dupont could reinforce him.
But it was already too late. The French
reached the entrance of the pass on the near
side to find it already occupied by the Russians,
who were pouring through in dense masses.
There were nearly 20,000 of them on that side
of him and 15,000 on the other, his former foes
now fast closing in from behind hard on his
heels. Mortier’s reduced ranks numbered barely
4,000 all told.</p>

<p>Owing to the high, steep rocks on one hand, and
the river on the other, it was impossible to push
past the Russians on either flank. All that could
be done was to attack in front and try to cut a
way through. That; or to surrender! With
reckless impetuosity the French attacked, firing
furiously and flinging themselves on the Russian
bayonets; while their rearguard, facing round,
kept their first foes back. For two long hours
they fought like that; their ranks swept by the
enemy’s cannon on each side. At length they
forced the entrance to the pass: but they could
get no farther. They had by then lost all their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
guns but two: but they still had all their Eagles.
With bullet-holes through some of them, and
their silken flags shot away or torn to tatters,
the Eagles did their part. Now they were rallying-centres;
now they were leading charges.
There was hardly a battalion in which the first
standard-bearer had not gone down.</p>

<p>All were fighting almost without hope, holding
out in sheer despair as long as they had cartridges
left, when, as that dreadful November
afternoon was drawing to its close, suddenly,
from beyond the far end of the pass was heard
the booming of a distant cannonade. The
soldiers heard it and hope revived. It could
only be Dupont! Help, then, was coming! The
despairing rank and file took heart again—but
the hour of rescue was not yet.</p>

<p>They had four long hours more to go through;
every hour making their terrible situation worse.
At nightfall “our cavalry gave way, our firing
slackened, our bayonets, from incessant use, became
bent and blunted. The confusion became
terrible. Things, indeed, could hardly have got
worse.” So an officer describes. The enemy,
in places, had got right in among them, but
“our soldiers, being the handier and more agile,
had an advantage over the great clumsy
Russians.” Here and there “the men were so
close, that they seized each other by the
throat.” In the midst of the fiercest of the
fighting the tall figure of the marshal was conspicuous.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
He was seen amid the flashes from
the muskets “at the head of a party of grenadiers,
sword in hand, laying about him like any
trooper.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“YOUR DUTY IS TO SAVE THE EAGLES!”</div>

<p>The Battalion-Eagles of the 100th, with their
Porte-Aigles and a handful of soldiers, got cut
off together, amid a surging <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> of Russians.
The major of the regiment, Henriot by name,
the senior surviving officer—the colonel of the
100th, as also the colonel of the 103rd, had
fallen earlier in the fight—saw what was happening
and the extreme peril of the Eagles. Calling
for volunteers, he got together some of his men,
cut his way through to the Eagles, and rescued
them. Major Henriot, after that, having saved
the Eagles for the moment, determined as a last
resource to attempt a forlorn-hope charge; to get
beyond the enemy and reach Dupont with them.
It might be possible to save them under the
cover of darkness. One of the Porte-Aigles
of the 6th Light Infantry with his Eagle, near by
at the moment, joined the devoted band of men
that the intrepid major now managed to rally
round the Eagles of the 100th. With half a
dozen stirring words Henriot called on them
to follow him. “Comrades, we must break
through! They are more than we, but you are
Frenchmen: you don’t count numbers! Remember,
your duty is to save the Eagles of
France!” (“Souvenez vous qu’il s’agit de sauver
les Aigles Françaises!”)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>There was a hoarse shout in reply: “We
are all Grenadiers! Pas de charge!”</p>

<p>They dashed at the Russians, Henriot leading,
and, after fighting their way through the pass
and nearly to Dürrenstein, fell to a man. Yet
the three Eagles did not fall into Russian hands,
thanks to the darkness. They were found next
morning by French search-parties under a heap
of dead, where the last survivors, fighting back
to back, had fallen while making their final
stand.</p>

<p>So desperate, indeed, did things look for the
French at one time, a little before midnight,
that some of his staff appealed to Mortier to
make his escape and get across to the other side
of the Danube in a boat, “so that a Marshal of
France shall not fall into the hands of the
enemy!”</p>

<p>But the gallant veteran flatly refused to listen
to the proposal.</p>

<p>“No,” was his answer, “certainly not! I
will not desert my brave comrades! I will save
them or die with them! Keep the boats
for the wounded,” he went on. “We have still
two guns and some case-shot—rally and make
a last effort!”</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterwards an opportunity
did offer for the marshal to save them.</p>

    <p>MARSHAL MORTIER.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">A DASH IN THE DARK TO HELP</div>

<p>Two of Dupont’s regiments at that moment
reached the battle. By persistent exertions,
outstripping the rest of the Second Division,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
and continuing in the dark, guided by the flashes
of the guns, they had made their way by a
goat-path along the steep rocky slopes at the
side of the defile and taken the Russians barring
Mortier’s retreat in rear. Instantly the new
arrivals flung themselves hotly into the fight.
They were the 9th Light Infantry and the 32nd
of the Line, that old favourite of Napoleon’s in
the days of the Army of Italy, whose flag on the
Eagle-staff bore, as has been said, the golden
inscription which Napoleon had placed there—“J’étais
tranquille, le brave 32me était là.”</p>

<p>The golden legend was of good omen for
Mortier.</p>

<p>Their interposition put the Russian main force
between two fires, weakening the attack on
Mortier and compelling a portion of them to face
about. Its effect was speedily felt, and at
once; although a desperate effort by the two
regiments to break through and join hands with
Mortier, in which the Eagles of the 9th
and 32nd were “taken and retaken,” was beaten
back under pressure of numbers.</p>

<p>The arrival of the two regiments so opportunely
put heart into all: Dupont’s whole division,
declared the marshal, could not be far off. He
himself would make an effort to meet him on
the farther side of the pass.</p>

<p>“Then,” as is described by Napoleon’s aide
de camp, Count de Sègur, “rallying and closing
up the remaining troops, he brought up the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
two guns left him. One was to point towards
Krems and against Kutusoff’s troops;
the other Mortier placed at the head of the
column, in the direction of Dürrenstein. As all
the drums had been broken he had the charge
sounded on iron cooking-cans.</p>

<p>“At that moment the Austrian general,
Schmidt, who had led the Russian corps from
Dürrenstein, headed a final charge which was to
strike a crushing blow and complete the destruction
of our column. But Fabvier (the
colonel in charge of Mortier’s artillery) heard
them advance. Concealed by the darkness, he
let Schmidt approach quite near. Then he
suddenly fired the gun on that side, at the
shortest range, in among the headmost of
the attacking troops. The discharge threw the
enemy into confusion and killed their leader.
Into this bloody opening Mortier and Gazan
precipitated themselves, overthrowing everything
before them. Dürrenstein itself was retaken
in the impetuous dash.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a <i lang="fr">tour de force</i>; a sudden reversal
of the fortunes of the fight. The feat in its
complete accomplishment surprised even Mortier’s
expectations. “The Marshal, in fact, could
hardly believe his own success.” So an officer
puts it. But he had done more than burst
through the toils. As daylight next morning
showed, the Russians, driven headlong, had
abandoned six of their guns, and left in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
hands of the French no fewer than twelve
standards. Two of them were taken by the
two Dupont regiments which had so gallantly
flung themselves on the Russian rear.</p>

<p>That was as concerned honour and glory.
As a set off, barely 2,000 remained of Mortier’s
corps of 6,000 men. Two-thirds of the total
when the roll was called next day were found to
have fallen on the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR FATE STILL IN DOUBT</div>

<p>Mortier’s men regained Dürrenstein, all in
flames; set on fire by the Russians as they
evacuated the village. But where was Dupont
and his Division? They had heard Dupont’s
distant guns just before dark; but except the
two regiments who had been rushed forward
independently, ahead of the main body, starting
immediately after Mortier’s visit in the early
afternoon, no help from Dupont had reached them.
Gazan’s wearied survivors of the midnight battle
dared not even yet lay aside their arms. The fight
was not all over. The enemy were still near
by; just beyond the outskirts of the village.
Both the Russian divisions that they had been
fighting with in front and rear had in the end
united. Outnumbering Mortier’s men as they
did by ten to one, the Russians would certainly
turn back and be on them before long with
re-formed ranks, eager to take vengeance for their
defeat and the rough handling they had undergone.</p>

<p>But the end was near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<p>Suddenly, from the farther side of Dürrenstein,
from the direction in which the enemy
had fallen back, there came a violent outburst
of firing. Immediately on that followed sounds
of shouting. Then there was the trampling rush
of a great host of men all making for the village.
“With despair in our hearts we were preparing
for another battle, when, in answer to our
challenge of ‘Qui vive?’ came back, with
electrifying effect, the answer ‘France!’ It
was Dupont. At last he had arrived to the
rescue of his Marshal.</p>

<p>“We recognised each other in the light of the
blazing houses, and with transports of joy and
gratitude and cries of ‘Long live our rescuers!’
our men threw themselves on the necks of their
deliverers.”</p>

<p>In that dramatic fashion the battle of Dürrenstein
reached its close. The Russians fell back
under cover of the night, retreating up the
lateral valley-pass, by which way at the outset
they had worked their way round, guided by the
Austrian general, Schmidt, to surprise and cut
off Gazan’s division.</p>

<p>Napoleon, in his great relief at learning that
Mortier had come through without disaster,
for once blamed nobody. He knew that he
himself was most of all to blame, for exposing
to sudden attack a comparatively weak detachment
of his army in the face of an enemy still
full of fight, on the farther side of a deep and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
rapid river. “It seemed,” in Marbot’s words,
“as if no explanation of this operation beyond
the Danube satisfactory to military men being
possible, there was a desire to hush up its consequences.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BY WAY OF COVERING THE BLUNDER</div>

<p>By way of covering up his own glaring blunder
Napoleon heaped praises on the troops engaged.
He expressed unbounded admiration at the
stand they had made. In the 22nd “Bulletin
of the Grand Army,” issued from Schönbrunn,
near Vienna, two days later, the Emperor declared
that “le combat de Dürrenstein sera à
jamais mémorable dans les annales militaires.”
Gazan, he said, had shown “beaucoup de valeur
et de conduite.” The 4me and 9me Légère and
the 32nd and 100th of the Line, wrote Napoleon,
“se sont couverts de gloire.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE FIELD OF AUSTERLITZ</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Austerlitz,</span> the crowning triumph of the First
War of the Grand Army, set its <i lang="fr">cachet</i> to the
fame of the Eagles.</p>

<p>Napoleon there lured the enemy on into
attacking him at apparent disadvantage on
ground of his own choosing. Then, availing
himself to the fullest extent of the flagrant
blundering of his assailants, he struck at them
with a smashing, knock-down blow from the
shoulder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LURED ON TO MEET THEIR FATE</div>

<p>By making believe that his army was separated
in detachments, out of touch, and beyond
possibility of early concentration, and causing
it to appear further that he had become alarmed
for his own safety and was on the point of commencing
a retreat, he decoyed them into a
false move. He tempted the Czar Alexander,
whose main force had arrived within a few miles
of Vienna, and was confronting him, into making
a rash manœuvre designed to cut his line of
communications and defeat him before the
second Austrian army in the field, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Archduke Charles, hastening from the Italian
frontier to join hands with the Russians, could
reach the scene. In the confident belief that
by themselves they outnumbered Napoleon at
the critical point by two to one, with nearly
90,000 men to 40,000, the Russians made a
risky flank march to interpose between Napoleon
and his base, and drive him in rout into the
wilds of Bohemia. They began their advance
suddenly, on Thursday, November 2, but immediately
afterwards wasted two days through
faulty leadership. Before they could get within
striking distance of Napoleon he had called in
his detached corps and had massed 70,000 men
at the point of danger. Foreseeing the possibility
of the enemy’s move, his apparent disposal
of the various corps had been elaborately
arranged so as to ensure concentration at short
notice in case of emergency.</p>

<p>From hour to hour during Sunday,
December 1, the Russian army in dense
columns streamed past within six miles of the
French position in full view of Napoleon, all
marching forward in stolid silence, intent only
on getting between Napoleon and Vienna. No
counter-move meanwhile was made from the
French side. Strict orders were sent to the
outposts that not a shot was to be fired. But
by the early afternoon all was ready for action.
Completely seeing through the enemy’s plans,
Napoleon exclaimed in a tone of absolute confidence:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“Before to-morrow night that army is
mine!”</p>

<p>On Napoleon’s right flank, in a strong defensive
position, stood Marshal Davout’s corps,
thrown back at an angle to the main front of
the army, so as to induce the enemy to extend
themselves widely on that side before opening
their attack. Marshal Soult’s corps, the most
powerful in the Grand Army, formed the centre;
supported by the Imperial Guard, Oudinot’s
Grenadier Division, and two divisions of Mortier’s
corps. Marshal Lannes’ corps, with Bernadotte’s,
was on the left, as well as Murat’s
cavalry. Napoleon proposed to allow the
Russian leading columns to circle round his
right flank and get into action with Davout.
Then, as soon as they were committed to their
attack in that quarter, Soult’s immense force
would hurl itself on the Russian centre and break
through it by sheer weight of numbers. Thus
the Allied Army would be cleft in two, after
which Napoleon would only have to fling his
weight to either side for the enemy to be destroyed
in detail. During Soult’s move, Lannes
on the left flank was to hold in check by a brisk
attack the Russian right wing and reserves,
which would prevent assistance reaching the
centre until too late to save the day. So the
battle was planned; so it was fought and won.</p>

    <p>Sketch Plan of the Positions of the Armies at
       the opening of the Battle of AUSTERLITZ</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Allied columns were seen during Sunday
afternoon to be steadily moving southward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
over a high ridge opposite the French camp,
crowned near the centre by the lofty plateau
of Pratzen, the key of the position on the Russian
side. They streamed along from the direction
of the village of Austerlitz, a short distance away
to the north-east, from which the battle took
its name. A tract of low marshy country, the
valley of the little river Goldbach, four miles
across, with two or three hamlets dotting it here
and there, connected by narrow cart-roads,
divided the two armies. The French position,
facing eastwards, was on a range of tableland
along the west side of the valley of the Goldbach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KEY OF THE POSITION</div>

<p>Monday morning came, and the “Sun of
Austerlitz”—so often apostrophised by Napoleon
in after days—rose in a cloudless sky above
the early mists lying dense over the marshy
ground of the low-lying valley between the
armies. The dominating crest of the Pratzen
plateau showed above the mist almost bare of
troops. On the evening before it had bristled
with Russian bayonets, glistening in the rays of
the setting sun. Pratzen, the master-key of the
battlefield, had been left unoccupied. The
enemy’s corps had taken no measures to hold it
in their haste to get forward to attack the French
right wing, and cut Napoleon off.</p>

<p>Soult’s corps—the entire French army had
been under arms since four o’clock—was ordered
to descend into the valley before the morning
mist dissipated as the sun rose. Under cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
of the mist Soult was to get as close as possible
to the foot of the Pratzen Hill, so as to be on
the spot ready to seize the height immediately
the battle opened on the right.</p>

<p>Napoleon waited, standing among the marshals
on foot near the centre of the position, until
between seven and eight o’clock. Then sharp
firing suddenly broke out from the direction of
Davout’s corps, and a few minutes later an
aide de camp came galloping up with the news
that the enemy were attacking the right wing
in great force. “Now,” said Napoleon, “is
the moment.” The marshals sprang on their
horses and spurred off to head their corps.</p>

<p>So Austerlitz opened.</p>

<p>Its first brunt, as Napoleon had foreseen, fell
hard and heavily on the French right wing;
but Davout’s men there proved well able to
maintain their ground. The sturdy linesmen on
that side disputed every foot of the position at
the point of the bayonet against four times
their numbers.</p>

<p>Right gallantly, time and again, did the Eagles
on that part of the field fulfil their rôle and take
their part; now heading charges, now rallying
round them the men who had sworn to die in
their defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SOLDIERS, I STAY HERE!”</div>

<p>The 15th Light Infantry—a corps in the ranks
of which were many young soldiers, now under
fire for the first time in their lives—stormed the
village of Tellnitz, which the Russians had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
carried in their first rush on the French outposts.
The leading battalion of the 15th drove the
Russians out; and, dashing on beyond the
village, met a reinforcing Russian column hastening
to the spot. They charged it without
hesitation, but could not break through, and
then they began to recoil before superior numbers.
The Eagle-bearer was shot down, and
fell badly wounded. He had to leave hold
of his Eagle, and amid the surging throng of
soldiers in disorder it was in great danger of
being trampled under foot and lost. Fortunately
the officer in command, <i lang="fr">Chef de Bataillon</i>
Dulong, saw what had happened, and sprang
from his horse and seized the Eagle. Holding
it on high with one hand, he shouted to his men
to stand fast. “Soldiers, I stay here!” he
called. “Let me see if you will abandon your
Eagle and your commander.” The act and
words checked the disorder. The battalion
rallied at once, re-formed ranks, and made
head against the enemy until help arrived, when
the Russians were driven back.</p>

<p>The Eagle of another battalion in the same
division of Davout’s army corps, General
Friant’s, the 111th of the Line, a little time later
had its part. The 111th had suffered heavily
in the earlier fighting, but towards eleven o’clock
were called on to lead a counter-attack beyond
the line of fortified hedgerow that the regiment
was holding, against a fresh Russian column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
which was advancing with loud shouts and
bayonets at the charge to storm their position.
Immediately in front was a wide, open stretch
of ground, across which a Russian battery, to
cover the attack, was pouring a tremendous
fire of shell, the bursting projectiles tearing up
the ground as if it were being ploughed. Just
as the order to advance was given, the Porte-Aigle
fell dead. An old sergeant, Courbet by
name, took his place. He seized the Eagle and
looked round, for several of the men were
wavering. They were unwilling to leave cover
for certain death, as it looked, on the shell-swept
space of open ground before them. Courbet
climbed over the hedge, and, waving the Eagle
and flag with both hands, stood by himself amid
the bursting shells, some twenty yards in front.
“Come on, comrades!” he shouted—“come on!”
Then with the words, “A moi, soldats du 111me!”
brandishing the Eagle, he ran straight at the
fast-nearing Russians. “The effect,” says one
who saw the brave deed done, “was electric.”
The men streamed over the hedge instantly,
re-formed line in spite of the cannon-balls, and,
led by the grenadiers of the battalion, charged
the approaching enemy, broke them, drove
them before them, and seized the village in
front, whence the Russians had made their
advance.</p>

<p>The Eagle of the 48th, another of Friant’s
regiments, in like manner was rallied in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
moment of supreme crisis by the daring of its
Eagle-bearer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUDDENLY FIRED ON BY FRIENDS</div>

<p>The Eagle of the 108th, which regiment was
fighting near by, all but fell into the enemy’s
hands through a blunder. It was early in the
morning, at the very beginning of the fight, in
crossing a marshy strip under cover of the mist,
to take in flank the Russian attack. In the
uncertain light another French regiment, the
26th Light Infantry, one of Soult’s regiments,
moving about a hundred yards on the left of
Davout’s men, mistook the 108th for the enemy,
and fired heavily into it. The Eagle-bearer
was among those shot down, and fell with the
Eagle. This sudden blow from an unexpected
quarter staggered the 108th. They fell back
hastily to re-form in rear, leaving their Eagle,
whose fall had been unobserved in the mist,
lying beside its dead bearer on the ground. The
loss was discovered just as another force of
Russians, who came up in front, reached the
place; but before they could carry off the trophy
a charge forward by some hastily rallied men of
the 108th recovered the Eagle and bore it back
to safety.</p>

<p>So far then with Davout’s corps.</p>

<p>Soult, meanwhile, in the centre, was striking
hard. His attack, in its effect on the Allied
Army, was a complete surprise. Soult’s advance
began the instant that the marshal, riding at
full gallop from the presence of Napoleon, could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
reach his men. At that moment the third of
the Russian columns in the order of march, pressing
ahead to overtake the first and second, and
join in the attack on Davout, had not long
descended the southern slope at the foot of the
Pratzen heights; while the fourth Russian
column, a mile or more in rear, was just about
to ascend the northern slope to cross the Pratzen
Hill and follow.</p>

<p>Up the steep western hillside face of the
Pratzen clambered Soult’s regiments. Unseen
by the enemy at any point, without a shot
being fired at them, or by them, until just as
they were nearing the crest-line of the ridge,
they emerged from the mists of the valley and
seized the high ground.</p>

<p>They moved on a front of three divisions.
Legrand’s was on the right, echeloned in the
direction of Davout’s left flank so as to keep
touch with that marshal. St. Hilaire’s was in
the centre, advancing in a long line of battalions
in attack formation. Vandamme’s division was
on the left.</p>

<p>The Allied fourth column caught a glimpse of
Vandamme’s men as they were climbing the
last ascent, and raced forward to form up and
bar their way. There were 14,000 troops in the
column, half Austrians, half Russians; and
the Czar Alexander with the Emperor of Austria
rode with them.</p>

<p>Attacking at once, the French broke through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the Allied front line, and, after a hard fight—for
the Austro-Russian regiments, fighting under
the two Sovereigns’ eyes, resisted with desperate
valour—forced it back on the second line with
the loss of several guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GRAPE-SHOT AT THIRTY PACES</div>

<p>Again there the Eagles took their part. On
the right of St. Hilaire’s attack, the brigade of
General Thiébault became separated in the
fighting with the Russian foremost line. Its
three regiments—the 10th Light Infantry, the
14th, and the 36th—became separated, and one
of them, the 36th, was for a time in danger of
being overpowered by part of the Russian
third column, which had faced about on hearing
the firing in rear and was hastening back up the
hill. Two Russian regiments raced up towards
them on that side. Some Austrian infantry of
the fourth column, extending in their direction,
were at the same time coming at them on the
left. In front the 36th was faced by two
Russian batteries, which dashed up, unlimbered,
and blazed away, firing grape and case shot at
barely thirty paces; as well as by some Russian
dragoons, who made as if about to charge. To
keep the dragoons off, the leading battalion
attempted to form square; but the men, breathless
after their rush uphill, were in some disorder
and for the moment out of hand. The square,
while yet half formed, was then nearly torn to
pieces by a staggering discharge of grape, and
several of the men began to get unsteady. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
looked bad for the 36th, when, of a sudden,
Adjutant Labadie, of the First Battalion, snatched
the Eagle from its bearer and ran out in front.
He stopped short and held the Eagle-staff with
both hands planted firmly on the ground. Then
he called to the men, in a momentary pause while
the Russian gunners were reloading: “Soldiers
of the 36th, rally to the front! Here is your line
of battle!” The men saw him, and obeyed.
The disorder ceased. Quickly deploying to right
and left, they dashed at the Russian guns. At
the same moment the other two regiments of
the brigade, led by St. Hilaire and the brigadier,
sword in hand, came up at the <i lang="fr">pas de charge</i>,
bayonets levelled. The 10th Light Infantry
brilliantly repulsed the Austrians on one side:
the 14th on the other side drove Kamenskoi’s
Russians back down the hill.</p>

<p>Supporting the 10th Light Infantry was the
59th of the Line, one of Mortier’s corps, of
Dupont’s division, which had been sent forward
to help in holding the Pratzen heights. Some of
the Russian dragoons dashed in among them as
they deployed to follow the 10th. A Russian
officer cut down the Eagle-bearer and seized the
Eagle. Sergeant-Major Gamier, the “Porte-Aigle,”
struggled to his feet in spite of his wounds,
wrested the Eagle back, and with his free hand
fought with his sword and killed the Russian,
saving the Eagle.</p>

<p>On St. Hilaire’s left, during this time, Vandamme’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
division had had to fight its way forward
against the Russians and Austrians of the
fourth column, several battalions of which,
with artillery, had rapidly taken post along a
range of knolls towards the northern edge of the
Pratzen plateau. Driving back at the outset
six Russian battalions, which charged forward
to meet them, springing up from the shelter of
a dip in the ground, Vandamme’s men, “without
firing a shot, with the bayonet only,
advanced on the main enemy with shouldered
arms, not replying to the Russian musketry.”
When within forty yards, they halted, fired a
volley, and dashed in with bayonets lowered.
The attack was successful beyond expectation.
The enemy before them were routed, and all
their guns taken, with many prisoners. Then
Vandamme received orders to wheel his division
to the right and take in flank the enemy, at that
moment in hot fight with St. Hilaire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RUSSIAN GUARD COME UP</div>

<p>Vandamme was in the middle of the move
when one of his brigades met with a sudden and
unexpected disaster. Two battalions belonging
to the 24th Light Infantry and the 4th of the
Line, who fought side by side on the extreme
left of Vandamme’s command, were all but
annihilated. As they were wheeling round,
the Russian Imperial Guard came up, hurrying
forward from the Reserve, and set on
them fiercely. It was just to the left of the
village of Pratzen, as approached from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
French side, on the farther side of the plateau.
The Russian Foot Guards forced the 4th and the
24th Light Infantry back into some vineyards
adjoining the village in disorder. The last to
retire was the First Battalion of the 4th. They
had hardly gained the edge of the tract of vineyards,
when, without the least warning of their
approach, coming up on their flank and unseen
in the smoke and turmoil of the contest, a more
formidable enemy still assailed them. The
Russian Cuirassiers of the Guard, 2,000 horsemen,
troopers of the finest cavalry in the world,
came down on them, and charged them at a
gallop on the flank. The Grand Duke Constantine,
brother of the Czar, in person led the Cuirassiers.
Disaster, hideous, overwhelming, crushing,
for the two hapless battalions—that of the
24th Light Infantry was, in like manner, caught
just beyond cover exposed in the open—was
the instant result. They tried to form
square at the last moment, but the Cuirassiers
were on them before they could begin the evolution.
Both battalions were practically hurled
out of existence within three minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW ONE EAGLE MET ITS FATE</div>

<p>They were ridden down, trampled on by the
huge Russian horses, and slashed to pieces
mercilessly by the giant Russian troopers with
their long straight swords. Both battalions
lost their Eagles. That of the 24th Light Infantry
was picked up later on the field and
restored to what was left of the ill-fated corps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
The Eagle of the 4th was carried off by the
Russians, and is now in the Kazan Cathedral at
St. Petersburg. Yet it was lost with honour;
bravely defended to the last. The Eagle-bearer
was cut down. A lieutenant tried to get hold
of the Eagle and save it; he, too, was cut down.
A private then snatched it from the dead
officer’s hands, and was in the act of waving
it on high when he in turn was sabred and fell.
The Russians made prize of the trophy at once,
and it was carried direct to the Czar Alexander
on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Napoleon, who had moved up near the fighting
in the centre, witnessed the disaster with his
own eyes.</p>

<p>The corps, as it happened, too, was one he
had taken an interest in. The 4th of the Line
had been in favour with him, and he had appointed
his brother Joseph as its colonel when
the 4th was at the Camp of Boulogne as part
of the “Army of England.” He had, indeed,
specially chosen that particular corps for its
steadiness. He announced Joseph’s appointment
to it in a message to the Senate on April 18,
1804, “in order that he should be allowed to
contribute to the vengeance which the French
people propose to take for the violation of the
Treaty [of Amiens] and be afforded an opportunity
of acquiring a fresh title to the esteem
of the nation.”</p>

<p>In wild panic the survivors of the disaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
fled to the rear, tearing by close past where
Napoleon and the Staff were. “They almost
rushed over us and the Emperor himself,”
describes De Ségur, who as an aide de camp
was close to the Emperor at the moment.
“Our effort to arrest the rout was in vain.
The unfortunate fellows were quite distracted
with fear and would listen to nothing. In reply
to our reproaches for so deserting the field of
battle and their Emperor, they shouted mechanically
‘Vive l’Empereur!’ and they fled away
faster than ever.</p>

<p>“Napoleon smiled pitifully. With a scornful
gesture, he said to us: ‘Let them go!’ Retaining
all his calmness in the midst of the confusion
he despatched Rapp to bring up the
Cavalry of the Guard.”</p>

<p>Rapp, another of the Imperial aides de camp,
was also Colonel of the Mamelukes of the Guard.
He was at the moment riding close behind the
Emperor. Rapp darted off, and, after taking
Napoleon’s order to charge the Russian Cuirassiers
to Marshal Bessières, in command of the
Cavalry of the Guard, he himself led their
headmost squadrons forward; his own swarthy
Mamelukes with two squadrons of Chasseurs
and one of Horse Grenadiers. Waving his
sabre and calling at the top of his voice, “Vengeons
les! Vengeons nos drapeaux!” “Avenge
them! Avenge our standards!” he led them
forward at full gallop. “We dashed at full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
speed on the artillery and took them,” described
Rapp in a letter. The guns were those of a
Russian battery which had just come into action
close by where the Guard Cuirassiers had
charged. “The enemy’s horse awaited our
attack at the halt. They were overthrown by
the charge and fled in confusion, galloping
like us over the wrecks of our squares.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“WE FOUGHT MAN TO MAN”</div>

<p>But the Russians rallied quickly. Reinforced
by the superb regiment of the Chevalier Guards,
a corps in which all the troopers were men of
birth, they came on to meet the French again.
Just at that moment Bessières, with at his back
the magnificent cavalry of Napoleon’s Guard,
came up at full speed. Rapp’s squadrons
rejoined, and both Imperial Guards met in full
career. “Again we charged,” says Rapp, “and
this charge was terrible. It was one of the most
desperate cavalry combats ever fought, and
lasted several minutes. The brave Morland,
Colonel of the mounted Chasseurs of the Guard,
fell by my side. We fought man to man, and
so mingled together that the infantry on neither
side dared fire, lest they should kill their own
men.” They fought it out until the Russians
gave back and broke and fled—in full sight of
the Czar and the Austrian Emperor, who from
some rising ground near by had been spectators
of the desperate affray.</p>

<p>The survivors of the hapless First Battalion
of the 4th of the Line had meanwhile recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
themselves. Rallied by their officers, they had
been brought back into the battle. They returned
with their nerve restored, now only
anxious to make amends for the disgrace they
had brought on the Grand Army. They were
in time to join in the final advance beyond
the Pratzen heights and cross bayonets with an
Austrian regiment, from which they took its
two standards. That feat, as will be seen,
was to serve them in good stead later on.</p>

<p>The charge of the Cavalry of the Guard
practically decided the fate of the day at
Austerlitz. Napoleon at once brought up
Oudinot’s Grenadiers, Bernadotte’s battalions,
and the regiments of the Old Guard to further
reinforce Soult’s divisions. The Allied centre
was shattered and driven in at all points, and
forced back for a mile-and-a-half beyond the field
of battle. It resisted desperately to the last,
and several fierce counter-attacks were made;
but in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOG THAT SAVED AN EAGLE</div>

<p>In one of these the Eagle of the Chasseurs à
Pied of the Imperial Guard had a narrow escape.
According to the story it was saved by a dog—“Moustache,”
a mongrel poodle that had
attached himself to the corps and become a
regimental pet. The Eagle-bearer of the First
Battalion, to whom the dog was much attached,
and whom he was following, was shot, and the
Eagle dropped to the ground beneath the man’s
body. An Austrian regiment was making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
counter-attack at that point, and before the
Eagle could be picked up, three Austrian soldiers
ran forward to seize it. Two of them attacked
the two men of the Eagle escort. The third
was faced by “Moustache,” who kept him off,
growling savagely and snapping at the Austrian
from behind the dead body of the Eagle-bearer.
The man dropped his musket, drew
his hanger, and cut at “Moustache,” slicing
off a paw. But in spite of that the dog managed
to keep him off until assistance came. Then
the three Austrians were bayoneted and the
Eagle was saved. Marshal Lannes, on hearing
the story, had a silver collar made for “Moustache,”
with a medal to hang from it, inscribed
on one side, “Il perdit une jambe à la bataille
d’Austerlitz, et sauva le Drapeau de son régiment”;
and on the other, “Moustache, chien
Français; qu’il soit partout respecté et cheri
comme un Brave.” “Moustache,” in the end,
it may be said, died a soldier’s death. He was
killed by an English cannon-ball at Badajoz,
and was buried on the ramparts there, with a
stone over him, inscribed: “Cy git le brave
Moustache.”</p>

<p>The Allied centre broken through, the end
came on swiftly all over the field of battle.</p>

<p>On Napoleon’s left wing, Lannes and Murat
had engaged the Russian rear column (or right
wing as they fronted to fight) immediately after
Soult opened the main attack. They had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
their part by holding in play the enemy in front,
thus preventing the Allied troops on that side
from moving up to reinforce the centre. There,
too, as elsewhere, the Eagles of Napoleon’s
battalions fulfilled their <i lang="fr">rôle</i>; one Eagle in
particular, that of the 13me Légère, achieving
special distinction. When the Allied centre
gave way, Lannes and Murat pressed forward
impetuously, forcing their antagonists back,
and driving them off the field to the north-east,
past the village of Austerlitz.</p>

<p>Davout, on Napoleon’s right, finished his
task at the same time; in no less workmanship
fashion. As Soult swung round his victorious
divisions to the right to take the Russian
left wing in rear, Davout’s moment came and
he gave the order to advance. Surging forward
with exultant shouts the stout-hearted defenders
of that fiercely contested side of the field swept
down on the assailants they had kept at bay for
five long hours. The Russians did their best to
make a brave resistance, but the day was lost.
Formed in close-packed columns they fell back,
losing guns and colours, and hundreds of prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTORS AND VANQUISHED</div>

<p>As darkness closed in, the last shots were fired
at Austerlitz. Crushing and complete had been
the overthrow. The Allied army fled in wild
panic. It left on the field 30,000 men, dead,
wounded, or prisoners, 100 guns, and 400 ammunition
caissons. Forty-five standards were in
the hands of the victors. Twelve thousand men
in killed and wounded was the price Napoleon
paid. It was a big price; but the victory to
him was worth the sacrifice. At five next
morning an aide de camp from the Austrian
Emperor presented himself before Napoleon to
beg for an immediate suspension of hostilities.
The Emperor Francis himself had an interview
with Napoleon during that afternoon, and, as
the result, terms of peace—to include the Austrian
Emperor’s Russian allies—were mutually
agreed on; to be formally settled between the
diplomatists as soon as possible, Pressburg in
Hungary being named for the meeting-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>We come now to the dramatic sequel to Austerlitz
which awaited the ill-fated First Battalion
of the 4th of the Line. They had to face Napoleon
and render account to him personally for
the loss of their Eagle. The dreaded interview
came some three weeks later; at a grand parade
of Soult’s corps before the Emperor at Schönbrunn—as
it befell, on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Napoleon, attended by the Imperial Staff,
most of the marshals, half a hundred other
officers of rank, and nearly as many aides de
camp, passed down the long line of troops,
congratulating most of the regiments on the
parts they had individually taken on the different
battlefields. In due course the Emperor
came to the regiments of Vandamme’s division,
ranged in their allotted place, the 4th of the
Line among them. Its First Battalion, reduced
by the disaster to a quarter of the normal
strength, stood at the head of the regiment,
looking gloomy and disconsolate, the only corps
on parade without its Eagle.</p>

<p>Napoleon approached the place with a frown
on his face and a look as black as thunder. He
reined up opposite the battalion and addressed
it in a loud angry tone.</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” he began hoarsely. “What have
you done with the Eagle which I entrusted to
you?”</p>

<p>The colonel of the regiment replied that the
Eagle-bearer had been killed at Austerlitz in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> when the Russian cuirassiers charged
the regiment, and the Eagle had been lost in
the tumult and confusion of the moment. There
was no survivor of those who had seen the
Eagle-bearer fall. The battalion, indeed, did
not know of its loss until some time later. One
and all deeply deplored what had happened,
but they desired to inform His Majesty most
respectfully that they, single-handed, had captured
two Austrian standards, and implored his
consideration on that account, begging that he
would allow them to receive a new Eagle in
exchange.</p>

<p>The whole regiment supported the colonel’s
request with loud shouts, “réclama à grands
cris.” But Napoleon’s countenance remained
unchanged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCATHING CENSURE AND BITTER SCORN</div>

<p>He replied coldly and contemptuously:
“These two foreign flags do not return me my
Eagle!” Then, after a pause, he launched
out into words of the severest censure and rebuke,
telling the men that he had seen them with his
own eyes in flight at Austerlitz. He poured
bitter scorn on their conduct, “in phrases,
stinging, burning, corrosive, which those present
remembered long afterwards—to the end of
their lives.”</p>

<p>Again the unhappy colonel pleaded his hardest
for his men. He entreated the Emperor’s
clemency, once more beseeching Napoleon to
allow that they had wiped out the slur on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
good name, and to grant the battalion a new
Eagle.</p>

<p>Napoleon said nothing for a moment. Then
he again addressed them in an abrupt tone:</p>

<p>“Officers, sub-officers, and soldiers, swear to
me here that not one of you saw your Eagle fall.
Assure me that if you had done so you would
have flung yourselves into the midst of the
enemy to recover it, or have died in the attempt.
The soldier who loses his Eagle on the field
of battle loses his honour and his all.”</p>

<p>“We swear it!” came the reply at once.</p>

<p>At that there seemed to come a change in
the Emperor’s mood. He paused once more
for a few moments, during which there was dead
silence. Then he raised his voice: “I will
grant that you have not been cowards; but
you have been imprudent! Again I tell you
that these Austrian standards—even, indeed,
were they six—would not compensate me for
my Eagle.”</p>

<p>He stopped short. He seemed to be musing
for a moment, looking straight into the eyes
of the men. After that, with a curt “Well,
I will restore you yet another Eagle!” Napoleon
turned his horse and rode on down the line of
troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEY FOUND THE OTHER EAGLE</div>

<p>It was quite true, as the colonel told Napoleon,
that the regiment was unaware at the time that
their Eagle had been lost. As a fact, search-parties—practically
all the survivors of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
First Battalion—were out on the day after
Austerlitz hunting over the battlefield among
the dead for their lost Eagle. By the irony of
fate it was they who picked up and restored
the Eagle of the 24th Light Infantry to their
fellows in adversity; the Russians, it would
seem, had not marked its fall in the confusion
of the fighting. At any rate it was left where
it fell and where it was found.</p>

<p>There was, as it curiously happened, no
reference in the Austerlitz Bulletin published
in France—the 30th “Bulletin of the Grand
Army”—to the loss of its Eagle by the 4th of
the Line, although the disaster to the battalion
is reported. “Un bataillon du 4me de Ligne
fut chargé par la Garde Impériale Russe à
Cheval et culbuté.” That was all that was
said on the subject. Yet, on other occasions
later, when Eagles were lost, mention was made
of the misfortune in one or other of the Bulletins,
with, generally also, some remark by way
of explaining away the unpleasant fact, and
now and then a caustic comment by Napoleon.
A picture connected with the incident was,
however, painted—at whose request is unknown.
It is now in the national collection of military
pictures of the campaigns of Napoleon at Versailles.
It shows the First Battalion of the
4th of the Line at the Schönbrunn review
“presenting Napoleon with two Austrian
standards taken by them from the enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
and claiming in exchange a new Eagle for
themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>This closing word may be said of the spoils
of the Eagles at Austerlitz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RECEPTION IN NOTRE DAME</div>

<p>The forty-five flags captured in the battle,
with five others selected from those taken at
Ulm, making fifty in all, were presented by
Napoleon to the Cathedral of Notre Dame.
With the trophies he sent this message: “Our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
intention is that every year on the 2nd of December
a Solemn Office shall be sung in the Cathedral
in memory of the brave men who fell on the
great day.” The flags were borne in triumph,
together with the trophies of the Ulm campaign,—120
captured standards and colours in all—through
the streets of Paris on January 15, 1806,
amid a tremendous demonstration of popular
enthusiasm. “The behaviour of the people,”
wrote Cambacérès, “resembled intoxication.”
Four days later the Austerlitz flags were received
at Notre Dame by the assembled Cathedral
clergy, Cardinal du Belloy at their head, with
elaborate religious ceremonial.</p>

<p>Said the Cardinal-Archbishop of Paris in his
address from the Altar-steps: “These banners,
suspended from the roof of our Cathedral, will
attest to posterity the efforts of Europe in arms
against us; the great achievements of our
soldiers; the protection of Heaven over France;
the prodigious successes of our invincible Emperor;
and the homage which he pays to God
for his victories.” Not one of the flags exists
now. They disappeared mysteriously, in circumstances
to be described later, in the early
hours of March 31, 1814, the day on which
the victorious Allies entered Paris, and Napoleon
withdrew to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Fifty-four of the other trophies paraded
through Paris, flags taken in the Ulm campaign,
were presented by Napoleon, as has been said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to the Senate. In return a picture of the scene
at the reception of the trophy-flags was ordered
to be painted for presentation to the Emperor.
It is now at Versailles.</p>

<p>The remaining sixteen trophies were divided
by order of the Emperor. Eight were sent to
the Assembly Hall of the Tribunate; eight to
the Hôtel de Ville as a gift to the city of Paris.</p>

<p>Thus did France receive the first spoils of the
Eagles.</p>

<p>“Soldiers,” said Napoleon to the Grand
Army, in his Austerlitz Proclamation; “I am
satisfied with you. You have justified my fullest
expectations of your intrepidity. You have
decorated your Eagles with immortal glory!”</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> curtain rises this time on an act in the War
Drama of the Eagles unique in the startling
incidents of its historic <i lang="fr">dénoûment</i>.</p>

<p>Prussia, in September 1806, threw down the
gage to Napoleon and drew the sword for a
trial of strength, with the full assurance of
victory. There was no doubt in Germany as
to the issue; not the least anxiety was felt.
No troops in the world, declared one and all,
could stand up to the Prussian Army. It was
easy, they said at Potsdam and Berlin, to account
for what had happened last year on the Danube.
Any sort of army could have won in that war.
Timidity and want of skill in the Austrian
generals, deficient training in the men, had
been, beyond dispute, the reason of the disasters.
It would be otherwise now. Napoleon would
have to meet this time the Army of Prussia;
the best drilled and smartest soldiers in the
world, organised and trained under the system
that the Great Frederick had originated and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
himself brought to perfection. “His Majesty
the King,” said one of the Prussian generals,
addressing a parade at Potsdam, “has many
generals better than Napoleon!” In the Prussian
Army, from veteran field-marshal to
drummer-boy, there were no two opinions as
to what must be the outcome of a clash of arms
with France. The wings of Napoleon’s Eagles
would be clipped once for all.</p>

<p>But to hurl defiant words was not enough.
Yet further to display contempt for their French
foes, the young officers of the Prussian Guard
marched one night in procession through the
streets of Berlin to demonstrate in front of
the French Embassy. Shouting out insults
and jeers, they brandished their swords before
the windows of the mansion and made a show
of sharpening the blades on the Ambassador’s
doorsteps. The Prussian King’s ultimatum
went forth, couched in language there was no
mistaking, and the Royal Guard Corps set out
from the capital for the frontier with flags
displayed and their bands playing triumphal
airs, chanting songs of the victories of the
Great Frederick, and shouting themselves hoarse
with cries of “Nach Paris!” All over Prussia
it was the same. The marching regiments
tramped through the towns and villages, their
colours decked with flowers, their bands playing,
and with the swaggering gait of victors returning
from conquest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A REPLY WITHIN A WEEK</div>

<p>The Prussian ultimatum, delivered on September
1, haughtily demanded a reply from
France within a week. It was accepted with
alacrity. Napoleon had foreseen all and laid
his plans. “Marshal,” he said to Berthier,
with a grim smile, as he read the ultimatum,
“they have given us a rendezvous for the 8th;
never did Frenchman refuse such an appeal.”</p>

<p>The Eagles never swooped to more deadly
purpose, with results more amazing and more
dramatic, than in that campaign.</p>

<p>Within three days of the firing of the first
shot, a Prussian division of 9,000 men had been
routed with heavy loss at Schleitz in Thuringia;
and Murat’s cavalry had captured elsewhere
great part of the Prussian reserve baggage-trains
and pontoon equipment. On the fourth
day of the war, at Saalfeld in Thuringia, 1,200
Prussian prisoners were taken and 30 guns.
In the battles of Jena and Auerstadt, both
fought on the same day, October 14, 20,000
Prussian prisoners, 200 guns, and 25 standards
were spoils to the Eagles. At Erfurth, on the
next day, a Prussian field-marshal with 14,000
men, 120 guns and the whole of the grand park
of the reserve artillery of the army were taken.
At Halle 4,000 Prussian prisoners were taken,
with 30 guns; at Lübeck 8,000 prisoners and
40 guns. Magdeburg, one of the strongest
fortresses in Europe, with immense magazines
and 600 guns on the ramparts garrisoned by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
16,000 troops, surrendered after a few hours’
partial bombardment. Stettin, a first-class fortress
mounting 150 guns, with a garrison of
6,000 men, surrendered without firing a shot.
The strong fortress of Cüstrin on the Oder, with
4,000 men in garrison and 90 cannon on the
ramparts, surrendered, also without firing a
shot, to a solitary French infantry regiment
with four guns. The fortress of Spandau,
garrisoned by 6,000 men, hauled down its flag
and opened its gates to a squadron of French
hussars, no other French troops being within
many miles, bluffed into surrender. Within
twelve days of Jena, Napoleon had made his
entry as a conqueror into Berlin, and the Prussian
Army had ceased to exist. “We have
arrived in Potsdam and Berlin,” announced
Napoleon in a Bulletin to the Grand Army,
“sooner than the renown of our victories!
We have made 60,000 prisoners, taken 65 standards,
including those of the Royal Guard,
600 pieces of cannon, 3 fortresses, 20 generals,
half of our army having to regret that
they have not had an opportunity of firing a
shot. All the Prussian provinces from the
Elbe to the Oder are in our hands.” Before
the end of the year, in little more than three
months from the firing of the first shot, a total of
100,000 prisoners, 4,000 cannon, 6 first-class
fortresses, and many smaller ones, were in the
hands of the victors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RUIN, SWIFT AND IRREPARABLE</div>

<p>Never had the world witnessed such an overthrow
in war, so complete and appalling a
catastrophe. Two battles sufficed to prostrate
Prussia and annihilate the model army of
Frederick the Great: the twin battles of Jena
and Auerstadt, both fought, as has been said,
on the same day, October 14, and within ten
miles of one another. Jena was fought under
Napoleon’s own eye; Auerstadt by Marshal
Davout, practically single-handed, with his one
army corps confronting the King and Blücher
with the main Prussian army. The Prussian
generals indeed gave themselves into Napoleon’s
hands at the outset. They separated their main
army into two bodies out of touch with each
other, in the immediate presence of the enemy.
Ruin, swift and irreparable, was the penalty.
At Jena, Prince Hohenlohe’s army was flung
roughly back and dashed to pieces, its scattered
remnants flying in wild disorder. At
Auerstadt, Davout defeated numbers nearly
double his own, through the confused tactics
of the Prussian generals. Immediately after
that came on the <i lang="fr">débâcle</i>. The Prussian Auerstadt
army was falling back, disheartened and
demoralised, but still in fair military formation
to a large extent, when, all of a sudden, not
having had up to then the least inkling of what
had happened at Jena, the retreating troops came
upon the shattered fragments of Hohenlohe’s
battalions, streaming in wild confusion across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
their path; masses of fugitives running for their
lives in frantic panic before the sabres of Murat’s
pursuing cavalry. That ended everything for
the Prussian army in five minutes. The sight
of their fugitive comrades struck confusion and
sheer fright into the retreating columns from
Auerstadt. All order was instantly lost: the
soldiers threw away their arms and spread over
the country in headlong rout. And there was
no means of stopping it. In their blind self-confidence
the Prussian generals had made no
arrangements in the event of a reverse. No
line of retreat had been arranged for, no rallying-point
had been thought of. “The disaster of a
single day made an end of the Prussian army
as a force capable of meeting the enemy in the
field.”</p>

<p>For the Eagles it was a day of adventures on
both battlefields. Swiftly alternating rushes
forward, the Eagles showing the way at the
head of their regiments at one moment; hasty
halts to form in rallying squares, the Eagles in
the midst, the next moment, to check the incessant
Prussian cavalry counter-charges—that
was what the fighting on the French side was
like, all through the day, at both Jena and
Auerstadt. At one time the Eagles were leading
forward charging lines of exultantly cheering
men, firing fast and racing forward at the <i lang="fr">pas
de charge</i>; immediately afterwards they were
standing fast, each the centre of a mass of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
breathless and excited soldiers, surging round and
closing up to form square, with bristling bayonets
levelled on every side, to hold the ground they
had won against the charging squadrons of
Prussian horsemen that came at them, thundering
down impetuously at the gallop.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“LEAD OUT YOUR EAGLE!”</div>

<p>“I want to see the Eagles well to the front
to-day!” said Napoleon to several regiments
in turn, as he rode at early dawn along the lines
of Marshal Soult’s two foremost divisions who
were to open the attack at Jena. To them the
task had been appointed to push forward in advance,
and hold the exits from the narrow defiles
through which the French troops had to pass,
before reaching the Prussians on the high ground
beyond, in order to give time to the main army,
following close in rear, to deploy and form in battle
order. “Lead out your Eagle, Sixty-fourth!”
Napoleon said to one of the regiments told
off to go forward in the forefront of all. “I
wish to-day to see the Eagle of the Sixty-fourth
lead the battle on the field of honour!” How
that Eagle led its regiment, how those who
fought under it did their duty, the prized honour
of special mention in the Jena Bulletin of the
Grand Army, and a shower of crosses of the
Legion of Honour, distributed among all ranks,
bore testimony. Five times did the Eagle of
the 34th, the regiment fighting next to the
64th, lead a charge, each charge crossing
bayonets with the enemy, twice in hand-to-hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
fight with the picked corps of the Prussian
Grenadiers.</p>

<p>It was on the battlefield of Jena that Marshal
Ney won his historic sobriquet of “The Bravest
of the Brave.” He personally led forward his
attack, with, at either side of him, the Eagles of
the 18th of the Line, the 32nd, and the 96th.
Carried away by his impetuous valour, soon after
the opening of the battle, Ney made his attack
with only at hand the three regiments of his First
Division. The other two divisions of Ney’s corps
had not yet reached the field. A regiment of
cuirassiers headed the column, and at their first
charge captured 13 Prussian guns; but the
Prussian cavalry, charging back at once to recover
the guns, overpowered the cuirassiers.</p>

<p>“The Prussian cavalry broke the French horse,
and enveloped the infantry in such numbers
as would inevitably have proved fatal to less
resolute troops; but the brave marshal instantly
formed his men into squares, threw himself into
one of them, and there maintained the combat
by a rolling fire on all sides, till Napoleon, who
saw his danger, sent several regiments of horse,
under Bertrand, who disengaged him from his
perilous situation.”</p>

<p>Ney’s other troops then joined the marshal,
coming up with their Eagles gleaming through
the battle-smoke: the Eagles of the 39th and
the 69th, of the 76th, the 27th, and the 59th.
Ney, extricated from his difficulties, went on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
again at once. “With intrepid step he ascended
the hill, and, after a sharp conflict, stormed the
important village of Vierzehn-Heiligen, in the
centre of the Prussian position. In vain Hohenlohe
formed the flower of his troops to regain the
post; in vain these brave men advanced in
parade order, and with unshrinking firmness,
through a storm of musketry and grape; the
troops of Lannes came up to Ney’s support,
and the French established themselves in such
strength in the village as to render all subsequent
attempts for its recapture abortive.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LET THEM COME ON!</div>

<p>This was the spirit in which, at Jena, Ney’s
men fought under the Eagles. One instance will
suffice. The 76th of the Line, after the village
of Vierzehn-Heiligen had been taken, were in the
act of advancing across the open to a fresh attack,
when a charge of Prussian cavalry swept fiercely
down on them. The regiment formed in square,
each battalion rallying round its Eagle, held up
aloft for all to gather round. The Prussians had
come up suddenly. They were within 150 yards
before the 76th were ready. Then the 76th
were ordered to “present” and fire. Instead of
doing that, the men, as if moved by one common
impulse, took off their shakos, stuck them on
their bayonets, and waved them in the air, with
defiant cheers of “Vive l’Empereur!” “Donnez
feu, mes enfants! Donnez feu!” (“Fire, men,
fire!”) shouted out their colonel, Lannier, anxious
lest the enemy should get too near. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
have time: at fifteen paces, Colonel; wait and
see!” came back in answer from the ranks.
They did wait, and, at just fifteen paces, fired a
crashing volley which so staggered the Prussians
that, leaving half their men on the ground, they
turned and galloped back.</p>

<p>The regiments of Lannes’ corps, with the fiery
marshal cantering at their head and waving
them on, cocked hat in hand, entered the battle
with drums beating and the Eagles proudly displayed
in the centre of the leading lines.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“HERE IS THE COU-COU!”</div>

<p>One regiment lost 28 officers and 400 men. It
had made good its first attack and was advancing
to a second, when it was charged in the open by
the Prussian cavalry, while in the act of forming
square. It all but lost its Eagle. The Eagle-bearer
was cut down, and the Eagle was broken
from its staff in the trampling tumult of horsemen
intermingled with infantry, savagely fighting
with their bayonets. A soldier saved the Eagle,
and in the hurry of the moment stuffed it into
the pocket of his long overcoat. Then he went
on fighting. Apparently the man had no time
or opportunity to think of the Eagle again.
The regiment was re-forming towards the close
of the battle, when Napoleon himself, riding across
the ground near them, with his quick glance,
missed the Eagle. He cantered up to the spot,
and, on being told by an officer that he did not
know where it was, angrily accused the men of
having lost their Eagle on the field. He began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
upbraiding them indignantly: “What is this?
Where is your Eagle? You have brought disgrace
on the Army by losing your Eagle!”
Those were his opening words. He was rating
the men angrily, when he was abruptly interrupted
by a voice from the ranks. “No, your
Majesty, no! they did not get it: they only
got a piece of the bâton! Here is the Cou-cou!
I put it in my pocket!” The soldier drew out
the Eagle as he spoke and held it up. There
was a loud outburst of laughter from the soldiers
at the unexpected turn of events, amid which
Napoleon, without a word more, turned and
rode off elsewhere.</p>

<p>At Auerstadt, where 30,000 French faced and
defeated 60,000 Prussians, the fighting was even
fiercer than at Jena. Recklessly the Prussian
horsemen, led in person by the dauntless Blücher,
repeatedly charged down on the French, who
formed in square everywhere to beat them back,
They did so at all points, and the Prussians only
wrecked themselves beyond recovery by their
efforts. In vain did the Prussian cavalry, as at
Jena, gallop up to the French bayonets again
and again. “In vain these gallant cavaliers,
with headlong fury, drove their steeds up to the
very muzzles of the French muskets. In vain
they rode round and enveloped their squares:
ceaseless was the rolling fire which issued from
those flaming walls: impenetrable the hedge of
bayonets which, the front rank kneeling, presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
to their advances.” Erect in the centre
of each French battalion square glittered its
Eagle, raised on high defiantly above the smoke
as the volleys flashed out all round.</p>

<p>Marshal Davout was seen at every point
wherever the regiments were hardest pressed.
From square to square the marshal galloped, as
opportunity offered in the intervals of the
Prussian attacks, “his face begrimed with sweat
and powder-smoke, his spectacles gone,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> his bald
head bleeding from a wound, his uniform torn,
a piece of his cocked hat shot away,” to exhort
the men to stand fast and hold their ground.
To one regiment he called out, as he reined up
beside its square: “Their Great Frederick said
that God gave the victory to the big battalions.
He lied! It’s the stubborn soldiers who win
battles; that’s you and your general to-day!”
Davout personally brought up support at one
point to rescue a sorely pressed division of four
regiments, General Gudin’s,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> holding the village
of Herrenhausen, on the right of the battlefield;
a post of vital importance to the fate of the day.
Taken by a brilliant dash forward early in the
battle, the village was held to the last, in spite of the
utmost endeavours of the Prussians to regain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AT BAY BEHIND A BARRICADE</div>

<p>The French kept the post at the cost of half
their numbers. One regiment, the 85th, on the
side of the village fronting the Prussians, lost
two-thirds of its men and was forced back and
compelled to abandon the outskirts. It kept
the Prussians at bay, however, within the
village, behind a barricade of overturned carts,
farm implements, and cottage furniture heaped
together. Close behind the firing line across
the village street the Eagle-bearer took his stand,
amidst a hail of bullets, mounted on a wheelbarrow
and brandishing the Eagle and calling
on the men to stand firm and fire low.</p>

<p>Marshal Davout brought up his First Division
of five regiments to rescue Gudin, heading them
sword in hand as he galloped forward. In doing
so he received his wound and had a narrow escape
of his life. “One bullet went through the
marshal’s hat just above the cockade.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>The 111th of the Line, of Davout’s Third
Division, had three Eagle-bearers shot down in
succession, a fresh officer coming forward to
carry the Eagle as his predecessor fell. All the
drummer-lads of the regiment were killed, whereupon
Drum-Major Mauser, dropping his staff,
picked up a drum and beat it as the regiment
advanced in its final charge. He ran forward
close beside the Eagle until he in turn fell shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
dead. This was in storming the village of
Spielberg, nearly at the close of the battle.</p>

<p>“The corps of Marshal Davout performed
prodigies,” wrote Napoleon in the Fourth Bulletin
of the campaign, commending with warmth
“the rare intrepidity of the brave corps.” He
ordered 500 crosses of the Legion of Honour
to be distributed in Davout’s corps, directing
that when the army reached Berlin, Davout
and the Third Corps should take precedence,
and their Eagles lead the triumphal entry
through the streets of the Prussian capital. At
a special review of Davout’s corps, calling the
marshal and his generals round him, he declared
his unbounded admiration of the feat of arms
they had achieved. “Sire,” replied Davout,
deeply moved at Napoleon’s words, “the
soldiers of the Third Corps will always be to
you what the Tenth Legion was to Caesar.”</p>

<p>At the attack on Halle, three days after Jena,
the 32nd of the Line, near the Eagle of which
regiment Ney had ridden at Jena, distinguished
themselves brilliantly. The Prussian Reserve
Army Corps was holding Halle and making a
gallant effort in a rearguard fight to safeguard
the passage there over the river Saale. Led by
the commander of Ney’s First Division, General
Dupont, in person, they stormed the bridge in
the face of a tremendous fire of grape and case
shot. Then, backed up by their comrades in
Ney’s First Division, the 18th and 96th and 9th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Light Infantry, they fought their way through
the city and, breaking open the gates, stormed
the heights beyond, foremost throughout in the
attack. Four times the Eagle-bearer of the 32nd
was shot down: each time a fresh officer sprang
forward to lead the regiment on. The 97th of
the Line, while fighting their way through the
streets of Halle at another point, found the
Prussian cannon mounted at a barricade too deadly
to face in the open, and the regiment recoiled
in confusion. Taking the Eagle from the Eagle-bearer,
Colonel Barrois called forward the
grenadier company. Leading them on himself
on horseback, holding up the Eagle with his
right hand, he went straight at the barricade,
which was stormed without touching a trigger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACROSS A CONQUERED LAND</div>

<p>Thenceforward there was only left for the
Eagles to choose the slain; to parade in triumph
across a conquered land. “Veni, Vidi, Vici,”
sums up the story of the after-events of the war
for the Eagles of Napoleon. The army of the
great Frederick committed suicide after Jena.
Its resistance collapsed: the army that had gone
forth in September to cross the Rhine and dictate
peace at the gates of Paris had ceased to exist
within six weeks. How completely indeed the
<i lang="fr">moral</i> of the Prussians had been shattered, this
story, from a report from Marshal Lannes to
Napoleon, serves to show. “Three hussars,”
related Lannes, “having lost their way towards
Grätz, found themselves in the midst of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
enemy’s squadron. They boldly drew their
carbines and, levelling them at the enemy,
called out that the Prussians were surrounded,
and must surrender at discretion. The Prussians
obeyed. The commander of the squadron, without
apparently a thought of resistance, ordered
his men to dismount, and they surrendered their
arms to those three hussars, who brought them
all in prisoners of war.”</p>

<p>General Lassalle, with a handful of hussars,
as has been said, captured the fortress of Stettin,
with 150 guns on its walls and a garrison of 6,000
men, by sheer effrontery. He rode up to the
main gate and demanded the surrender within
five minutes; and the governor capitulated on
the spot. “If your hussars take strong fortresses
like that,” wrote Napoleon to Murat, on
hearing the news, “I have nothing to do but
break up my artillery and discharge my engineers.”
Prince Hohenlohe with 14,000 men and
50 guns, his troops including the Royal Prussian
Guard and six regiments of Guard cavalry,
laid down their arms at Prentzlau. A few miles
away, 8,000 more Prussians surrendered on the
same day to a French brigade of dragoons. The
unfortunates were remnants of the troops beaten
at Jena, and had been relentlessly pursued for
ten days.</p>

<p>The 7th Hussars forwarded to Napoleon as
their spoils from a three days’ chase, 7 Prussian
cavalry standards; those of the Anspach and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
Bayreuth Dragoons; the Queen of Prussia’s
regiment; and 4 standards of the Light Cavalry
of the Guard. Marshal Lannes sent Napoleon
40 Prussian standards taken between Jena and
Berlin. Bernadotte and Soult presented 82 more
trophies, the spoils of Blücher’s army, forced to
surrender at Lübeck after a forlorn-hope fight
in the course of which the city was stormed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE FINEST FEAT OF ARMS”</div>

<p>Marshal Ney took the fortress of Magdeburg
without having a single siege-gun, and with only
11,000 men at hand to deal with 24,000 in the
garrison and 700 guns on the ramparts, some of
these being the heaviest artillery of the time.
It was perhaps the most surprising event of the
war. The taking of Magdeburg, wrote Junot,
“is the finest feat of arms that has illustrated
this campaign.” Ney had been ordered to blockade
Magdeburg until a sufficient army was
available for the siege of the fortress, which
Napoleon expected would be a long and difficult
affair. But so tedious a task as a blockade
was not at all to Ney’s taste. To hasten matters
he sent for half a dozen mortars, taken at Erfurt,
and began throwing shells into the suburbs on
the side nearest him. The bombardment caused
a scare among the townsfolk. Panic-stricken at
seeing their houses set on fire and destroyed by the
bursting shells, they hastened to General Kleist,
the governor of Magdeburg, an elderly and
nervous old gentleman of between seventy and
eighty years of age, and implored him to ask<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
terms of the French marshal. Dismayed himself
at the prospect of a siege, with disorder
rampant among the military—nearly half the
garrison was made up of fragments of fugitive
regiments from Jena who had fled to Magdeburg
for shelter from the pursuing French—Kleist,
losing his nerve in the face of the alarming
situation, agreed to negotiate for terms.
Ney’s reply was a demand for instant surrender,
whereupon the wretched governor, although he
had more than enough good troops at disposal,
without counting the Jena fugitives, to have
made a stubborn defence, tamely hoisted the
white flag.</p>

<p>The march out of the garrison of Magdeburg
was a repetition of the Austrian humiliation of
Ulm on a lesser scale. The standards of the
Black Eagle in their turn had at Magdeburg
publicly to acknowledge defeat before the Eagles
of Napoleon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GARRISON LAYS DOWN ARMS</div>

<p>Ney drew up his 11,000 men in a great hollow
square outside the Ulrich gate of the fortress.
His troops were drawn up along three sides of
the square; the fourth side, that nearest the city,
being left open. In front of the regiments stood
their Eagles, all paraded as at Ulm, the Eagle-guards
beside them, and the regimental officers
standing in line with their swords at the carry.
The Prussians marched out and, to the music of
the French bands, passed in procession along
the three inner sides of the square, and in front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
of Marshal Ney and his staff. The miserable
Kleist led them, and then took his stand beside
Ney, to answer the marshal’s questions as to who
and what the various regiments were, as each
set of downcast Prussians trailed past. They
tramped by, with their muskets on their shoulders
unloaded and without bayonets, and with their
colours furled. The hapless prisoners, after
they had defiled past, were at once marched
away under escort on the road to Mayence.
Twenty generals, 800 other officers, 22,000
infantry, and 2,000 artillerymen, with 59
standards, underwent the humiliation of the
defilade.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> There were several painful scenes
at the laying down of the arms. “Their soldiers
openly insulted their officers,” describes one of
the French lookers-on. “Most of them looked
terribly ashamed of themselves; the faces of not
a few were streaming with tears.”</p>

<p>At Magdeburg, as in the other surrenders
elsewhere, it was not the personal courage of the
officers and soldiers that was wanting—there were
men by thousands in the various garrisons ready<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
to give their lives for the honour of their country;
it was the generals in command whose nerve
lacked. The generals were men past their
prime, and mostly physically incapable of enduring
hardships. They had been appointed to their
posts, in accordance with the system in vogue
in Prussia, for the sake of the emoluments.</p>

<p>“The overthrow of Jena,” to use the words
of a modern writer, “had been caused by faults
of generalship, and cast no stain upon the
courage of the officers; the surrender of the
Prussian fortresses, which began on the day
when the French entered Berlin, attached the
utmost personal disgrace to their commanders.
Even after the destruction of the army in the field,
Prussia’s situation would not have been hopeless
if the commanders of the fortresses had
acted on the ordinary rules of military duty.
Magdeburg and the strongholds upon the Oder
were sufficiently armed and provisioned to detain
the entire French army, and to give time to
the King to collect upon the Vistula a force as
numerous as that which he had lost. But
whatever is weakest in human nature—old age,
fear, and credulity—seemed to have been placed
at the head of the Prussian defences.” Küstrin
on the Oder, “in full order for a long siege, was
surrendered by the older officers, amidst the
curses of the subalterns and the common soldiers:
the artillerymen had to be dragged from their
guns by force.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>At Magdeburg, indeed, before the march out,
the younger officers of the garrison mobbed
General Kleist, hooting at him and cursing him
to his face; some of them, further, being with
difficulty stopped from acts of personal violence.</p>

<p>There yet remained one day more for the
Eagles. The triumphal parade of the victorious
Eagles through Berlin was the crowning humiliation
that Napoleon imposed on vanquished
Prussia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHAL DAVOUT IN BERLIN</div>

<p>Davout’s corps, as Napoleon had promised,
marched through the Prussian capital first of
all. The marshal was waited on as he entered
by the Burgomeister and civic authorities,
humbly bowing before him, and offering in
token of submission the keys of Berlin. The
offer, however, was declined. “You must present
them later,” was the reply; “they belong to
a greater than I!” After marching through
Berlin, Davout camped a mile beyond the city,
posting his artillery “in position as for war,
pointed towards the place as in readiness to
bombard it.” The soldiers were then allowed
to go about Berlin in parties. They behaved
very quietly, and made eager sightseers, we are
told. The shops, which had been closed during
the march through, reopened later, and the
people went about the streets as usual, “mortified
and subdued in demeanour, but apparently
very curious to see what they could of the French
officers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>Augereau’s corps, and then those of Soult,
Bernadotte, and Ney made their triumphal
entry and march through Berlin in turn, on
different days later on, bands playing and
Eagles displayed at the head of the regiments—the
people turning out on each occasion in crowds
to line the streets and gaze at the show, “expressing
great surprise at the small size of our men
and the youth of most of the officers.” Marshal
Ney’s corps brought with them their fifty-nine
trophies from Magdeburg, and, after parading
them through the streets of Berlin, ceremoniously
presented them to Napoleon in public, in front
of the statue of Frederick the Great.</p>

<p>Napoleon himself made his triumphal entry
into Berlin on October 28, three days after
Davout’s march through. He rode from Charlottenburg
through the Brandenburg Gate and
along Unter-den-Linden to the Royal Palace,
at the head of the Old Guard and six thousand
cuirassiers in gleaming mail. Squadrons of
Gendarmerie d’Elite and Chasseurs of the Guard
and the Horse Grenadiers, in their huge bear-skins,
led the long procession, all in <i lang="fr">grande tenue</i>,
with their bands playing and the Eagles glittering
in the brilliant sunshine of a perfect autumn
day.</p>

<p>Napoleon came next, “riding by himself, twenty
paces in front of the staff, with impassive face
and a stern expression,” passing amid dense
silent crowds, “the men all wearing black, as in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
mourning; the women mostly with handkerchiefs
to their eyes.” The people lined both
sides of the roadway, and filled the windows of
all the houses overlooking the route. All Berlin,
young and old, was in the streets that day,
staring at the spectacle in mute silence, looking
on dumbly, pale-faced and miserable of aspect.
Not a mutter of abuse was heard, not the least
sign was apparent of the deadly hatred to their
conqueror that one and all felt. With rage and
despair in their hearts, with compressed lips and
clenched fists at their sides, the men watched
the splendid array sweep proudly past them in
all the insolent pomp of victorious war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON RIDES THROUGH</div>

<p>For once, on that historic occasion, Napoleon
discarded his customary wear of the green undress
uniform of his pet corps, the Chasseurs of
the Guard. He entered Berlin as the head of a
conquering army, wearing the full-dress uniform
of a French general, crimson plumed cocked hat
with blue and white aigrette, blue coat heavily
embroidered with gold, and with glittering bullion
epaulettes, and the blue and gold sash of a
general round his waist. Four marshals, Berthier,
Lannes, Davout, and Augereau, riding
abreast, followed Napoleon, immediately in front
of the Imperial Staff, a cavalcade of a hundred
and more brilliantly decorated officers, all in
their most gorgeous parade uniforms, in celebration
of the day. The keys of the city were
presented to the conqueror, and accepted by him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
as Napoleon passed through the Brandenburg
Gate. Ten thousand infantry of the Old Guard,
in a vast solid column of glistening bayonets,
marched, twenty abreast, in rear of the staff.
Their famous band playing triumphantly, with
the Eagle of the Grenadiers of the Old Guard
above its flag of crimson silk and gold, heading
the veterans. They also were all in the full-dress
uniform they wore on gala-day parades before
the Tuileries. By Napoleon’s special order, the
Old Guard on all campaigns carried in their
knapsacks their full-dress uniform, specially for
donning on occasions such as that at Berlin.</p>

<p>But the cup of humiliation for the miserable
citizens of the Prussian capital was not yet full.
They had yet another military spectacle with a
significance of its own to witness; one the deep
humiliation of which they felt more bitterly
even than Napoleon’s triumphant ride in person
through their streets. The citizens of Berlin
had to look on their own officers of the Royal
Prussian Guard being led in procession through
their midst under the armed escort of Napoleon’s
grenadiers. That was Napoleon’s way of settling
accounts for that August night of wanton insult
to France, for the sharpening of the sword-blades
on the steps of the French Embassy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PRISONERS FARMED OUT</div>

<p>Nor, too, did Napoleon spare the Prussian
prisoners of the rank and file. Writing from
Berlin to the Minister of the Interior in Paris,
he gave directions that the Prussian captives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
should be made use of as hewers of wood and
drawers of water for their conquerors. They
were to be farmed out to municipalities and
district councils in the Departments. “Their
services should be turned to account at a trifling
expense in the way of wages for the benefit of
our manufacturers and cultivators and replace
our conscripts called to serve in the ranks of the
Grand Army.”</p>

<p>Napoleon stayed in Berlin for four weeks,
while the marshals were leading the Eagles
through Eastern Prussia towards the Polish
frontier. Russia had taken up the cause of her
defeated neighbour, and the armies of the Czar
were on the move to rescue what was left of the
Prussian army. Less than 15,000 men were
all that remained in the field to show fight,
of 200,000 soldiers who, not two months before,
had been on the march against France in full
anticipation of victory.</p>

<p>In the Royal Palace of Berlin Napoleon received
with elaborate ceremony the deputation
of the French Senate sent from Paris specially
to congratulate the victor of Jena in the enemy’s
capital. He took advantage of the unique occasion
for the formal presentation and handing
over to their charge, for conveyance to Paris, of
the trophies of the war—340 Prussian battle-flags
and standards.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Forty of the trophies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
presented to the Senate on that day at Berlin
are now among the array of trophies grouped
round Napoleon’s tomb in the Invalides.</p>

<p>Napoleon handed over to the charge of the
deputation at the same time, for transfer to the
Invalides, his own personal spoil—the sword of
Frederick the Great. It was removed—all the
world knows the story of the unpardonable
outrage—by Napoleon’s own hand from its
resting-place on the royal tomb at Potsdam.
“I would rather have this,” he said to the
officers beside him in the royal vault as he took
possession of the sword, “than twenty millions.
I shall send it to my old soldiers who fought
against Frederick in the campaign in Hanover.
I will present it to the Governor of the Invalides,
who will guard it as a testimonial of the victories
of the Grand Army and the vengeance that
it has wreaked for the disaster of Rosbach. My
veterans will be pleased to see the sword of the
man who defeated them at Rosbach!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">FREDERICK THE GREAT’S SWORD</div>

<p>The trophies started for France forthwith
under military escort, and Paris went mad with
exultation at the sight of them. On the day of
the State Procession which escorted the trophies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
from the Tuileries to the Invalides it proved
almost impossible to keep back the enormous
crowds that thronged the streets along the route,
in spite of cordons of gendarmerie and regiments
of dragoons. Deputations of veterans and
National Guards, with the Eagles of the Departmental
Legions, led the way. Then came Imperial
carriages with exalted official personages.
The trophies had their place next, displayed in
clusters of flags all round a gigantic triumphal
car. Marshal Moncey, the acting Governor of
Paris, rode a few paces behind the car of Prussian
standards, holding up the trophy of trophies
before the eyes of the wildly cheering onlookers—Frederick
the Great’s sword. A gaily attired
train of generals and staff officers attended the
marshal. The rear of the procession was brought
up by the battalions of the Guard of Paris, their
Eagles being borne amid rows of gleaming bayonets.
Salvos of artillery from the Triumphal
Battery greeted the arrival of the trophies at the
Invalides, where the veterans awaited them,
drawn up on parade before the Gate of Honour.
As Napoleon had specially directed, the Hanoverian
War veterans of the Invalides met and
escorted Marshal Moncey to the chapel at the
head of other specially nominated veterans, who
bore, marching in procession, the Prussian
trophy-standards. The trophies were deposited
with an elaborate display of ceremonial in front
of the High Altar, after which Fontanes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Public Orator of the Empire, delivered an
address full of glowingly eloquent passages on
the glorious achievements of the Grand Army
and the “resplendent magnificence of the leader
who had led the Eagles to surpassing triumphs!”</p>

<h3 id="toclink_150"><span class="smcap">The Twelve Lost Eagles of Eylau</span></h3>

<p>Napoleon passed from the victorious fields of
Prussia to the rough experiences of the Eylau
and Friedland campaigns, which followed as
the sequel to Jena on the plains of the Polish
frontier. The Eagles there had to undergo under
fire vicissitudes of fortune that were a foretaste
of the fate in store for some of them later on, at
the hands of the same enemy, in the Moscow
campaign. No fewer than fourteen of the Eagles
borne in triumph through Berlin after Jena were
on view within a twelvemonth as spoils of war
in the Kazan Cathedral at St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The Eagle of Marshal Ney’s favourite regiment
in the battle-days of the Ulm campaign,
the 9th Light Infantry, was the first to meet
adventures in the Polish War. It was on the
occasion of the surprise of Bernadotte’s army
corps, at Möhringen near the Vistula, in the last
week of January 1807. The Grand Army was
lying in winter quarters to the north of Warsaw,
awaiting the reopening of the campaign in the
early spring, when the Russian army, breaking
up unexpectedly from its cantonments beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the Vistula in the depth of winter, made a dash
at Bernadotte’s outlying troops, posted by themselves
at some distance from the main army and
scattered in detachments over a wide tract of
country for reasons of food-supply. Bernadotte
only got news of the enemy’s approach
just in time; practically at the eleventh hour.
He was rapidly concentrating his corps at Möhringen,
but barely half his troops had been able
to reach the point of danger when the Russians
struck their blow. He was able with the troops
nearest at hand to avert destruction, but the
escape was a narrow one and his losses were very
heavy, all his baggage falling into the hands of
the enemy. Fortunately for the French the
Russian advanced guard attacked prematurely
and was beaten back, after which Bernadotte
made good his retreat to a safer neighbourhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUR TIMES TAKEN AND RETAKEN</div>

<p>The 9th Light Infantry were in the forefront
of the fighting, which was at the closest quarters,
the soldiers on both sides meeting man to man.
Four Eagle-bearers of the 9th fell, one after
the other. Four times the Eagle was taken by
the Russians and recaptured at the point of the
bayonet. A fifth time the Eagle-bearer went
down, and on his fall this time the Eagle disappeared,
while the 9th were driven back,
broken and in disorder. They were quickly
rallied again, however, and led once more to the
charge, “going forward to the combat with the
fury of despair.” This time their impetuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
onset forced the Russians to give ground.
Advancing with shouts of victory, they stormed
the village of Psarrefelden, immediately in front
of them, and there seized part of a Russian
ammunition train. While searching for fresh
cartridges in one of the enemy’s ammunition
wagons to replenish their empty cartouche-boxes
an officer, to his surprise, came upon the lost
Eagle. It had been broken from its staff in
the last fight round it, and its Russian captor,
probably having enough to do to look after himself
without carrying it about, had apparently
thrust it hastily into the ammunition wagon on
top of the cartridges. At any rate there the
Eagle of the 9th Light Infantry was found, and
so it was regained. The broken staff and flag
were missing and were never seen again, but the
all-important Eagle had been recovered. It was
hurriedly mounted on a hop-pole, found leaning
against a peasant’s hut near by, which was improvised
for a staff, and on that the Eagle was
carried to the close of the fighting that day,
after which the 9th retreated with the rest of
Bernadotte’s corps.</p>

<p>Napoleon specially decorated the lieutenant
who recovered the Eagle, and who also had
led more than one of the charges to rescue it in
the earlier fighting. He gave him the cross of
the Legion of Honour with a money grant. He
further recorded the recovery of the Eagle—though
without mentioning how it was got back—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the 55th Bulletin of the Grand Army, dated
Warsaw, January 29, 1807:</p>

<p>“The Eagle of the 9th Light Infantry was
taken by the enemy, but, realising the deep
disgrace with which their brave regiment would
be covered for ever, and from which neither
victory nor the glory acquired in a hundred
combats could have removed the stigma, the
soldiers, animated with an inconceivable ardour,
precipitated themselves on the enemy and routed
them and recovered their Eagle.”</p>

<p>So Napoleon wrote history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE FIRST DAY AT EYLAU</div>

<p>Two Eagles met their fate in the first day’s
fighting at Eylau—in the preliminary combat
on February 7, which formed the opening phase
of the terrific encounter next day. At Eylau—a
small township some twenty-two miles to the
south of Königsburg—Napoleon in person commanded
with 80,000 men in the field, and met
with his first serious check in a European war.
In following up the Russian rearguard on the
afternoon of the 7th, as it fell slowly back to
rejoin its main body, drawn up in position on the
farther side of Eylau, on ground chosen beforehand
by the Russian leader for making a stand,
two of Napoleon’s battalions, while pressing
hotly forward after the enemy over the open
plain, some two miles from Eylau, were overpowered
and cut to pieces. They had charged
and were driving in the nearest Russians to them,
when a Russian cavalry regiment, the St. Petersburg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Dragoons, unexpectedly came on the scene.
Sweeping round amidst the tumult of the fighting,
the dragoons rode into them on the flank. The
two battalions were slaughtered almost to a
man within five minutes, before help could get
to them, and their Eagles were snatched up and
borne away. It was an act of expiation for the
St. Petersburg Dragoons. On the previous day
Murat’s pursuing hussars had charged and
broken them, putting them to flight, and in a
wild panic they had ridden over one of their own
regiments, trampling their comrades down, with
loss of life. To retrieve their character the St.
Petersburg Dragoons now went savagely at the
two French battalions, riding them down with
reckless daring and relentless fury, giving no
quarter. Their capture of two of Napoleon’s
Eagles in one charge, the taking of two Eagles
by a single regiment, stands on its own account
as a unique achievement.</p>

    <p>Sketch Plan of the Battlefield of EYLAU</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Eylau—the historic battle of February 8, 1807—was
fought in the depth of winter; in the
midst of a flat expanse of a desolate snow-plain
and ice-bound marshes; under dreary lowering
skies of leaden grey; amid howling gusts of
piercing wind, with driving snow-storms sweeping
intermittently across the field of battle. A
hundred and fifty thousand men on both sides
faced each other at the break of day, after passing
the night with their outposts within shot of one
another, the soldiers all lying in an open bivouac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
on the snow, round their watch-fires, wrapped
up in their cloaks, the only shelter from the bitter
cold. They fronted each other in the grey dawn
“within half-cannon shot, their immense masses
distributed in dense columns over a space in
breadth less than four miles. Between them
lay the field of battle, a wide stretch of unenclosed
ground, rising on the Russian side to a
range of small hills. All over the plain, ponds
and marshes intersected the ground, but far and
wide all was now covered over with ice and
deep snow.”</p>

<p>Napoleon began the battle with a fierce cannonade,
opening a terrific fire all along the line
with no fewer than 350 guns. The Russians
replied at once, firing back even more furiously
and with yet more guns. For almost an hour
nearly 800 cannon belched forth shot and
shell on either side; an artillery duel perhaps
unparalleled in war. Then, in the midst of
the cannonade, Napoleon launched his first
attack. Fifteen thousand men of Augereau’s
corps moved out from the centre of the French
line to storm the Russian position. They went
forward, massed in two immense columns, with,
in support, a third column of one of Soult’s
divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOING FORWARD TO THEIR DOOM</div>

<p>They went forward to their doom: to meet
disaster, swift, terrible, overwhelming, and to
leave two of their Eagles in the hands of the
enemy as mementos of their fate. Yet they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
not given up; neither of those Eagles was
surrendered. They remained on the field amid
the dead; left behind because there was not a
man living of their regiments to defend them.
They lay where they fell, surrounded by the
soldiers who had died in their defence; lying
on the snow for the Cossacks to pick up and
carry away. They were the Eagles of the 14th
and the 24th of the Line.</p>

<p>The Russians turned their guns on Augereau’s
corps directly it commenced its advance; it
was sheer massacre for the French, as the fierce
tornado of cannon-balls crashed into the thick
of the densely massed columns. Whole companies
were swept away, mowed down, on every
side. “Within a quarter of an hour, half of the
corps were struck down.” The rest, though,
with stolid endurance, held firmly on their way.
The soldiers went doggedly on; only halting
for a moment now and again to close up their
shattered ranks. At that moment, as they were
nearing the Russian position, a furious snow-storm
burst over the battlefield, the snow blowing
right in the faces of the French. “It was impossible,”
one of the survivors told, “to see
anything at all in front; we could at times barely
see a foot before us.” All, in spite of that, however,
laboured bravely to get forward; without
wavering, and regardless of the merciless fire of
the Russian guns, which never ceased for one
moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">OVERWHELMED IN A SNOWSTORM</div>

<p>Then, as the snow-blinded soldiers struggled
on, when the storm of whirling snow was at its
worst, all in an instant the catastrophe happened.
Without warning, coming from nowhere,
as it seemed, an enormous mass of Russian
horse, dragoons and Cossacks, charged suddenly,
amid an infernal din of furious shouting, into
them. “So thick was the snow-storm, and so
unexpected the onset, that the assailants were
only a few feet off, and the long lances of the
Cossacks almost touching the French infantry
when they were first discerned.” The Russians
swept down on all sides of the two divisions;
charging them in front and flanks and rear at
once, the dragoons sabring them right and left,
the Cossacks stabbing at them with their long
eighteen-foot lances.</p>

<p>“The combat was not of more than a few
minutes’ duration; the corps, charged at once
by foot and horse with the utmost vigour,
broke and fled in the wildest disorder back
into Eylau, closely pursued by the Russian
cavalry and Cossacks, who made such havoc,
that the whole, above 15,000 strong, were, with
the exception of 1,500 men, taken or destroyed;
and Augereau himself, with his two generals of
divisions, Desjardins and Heudelet, was desperately
wounded.”</p>

<p>Cut off in one part of the field and hemmed in,
the 24th of the Line, “one of the finest regiments
in the Grand Army, and itself almost equal to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
brigade,” as a French officer speaks of it, was
destroyed to a man. It refused to turn its back
to the enemy, and stood its ground to face its
fate. The 24th were slaughtered as they stood
in their ranks. Colonel Sémelé and a devoted
band of soldiers fought round the Eagle to the
last, and fell dead beside it. A Cossack picked
the Eagle up and rode off with it.</p>

<p>The 14th had led the attack. It had lost
heavily from the Russian cannonade, but was
still pressing on when the cavalry came charging
down. The regiments next following it, however,
had suffered still more heavily from the artillery
fire. They were swept away <i lang="fr">en masse</i> by the
Cossack rush. Thus the 14th were cut off and
left by themselves, barely half a battalion of
men in numbers, in the midst of the raging
torrent of Cossacks and dragoons. The survivors
hastily threw themselves into a square
on and round a low elevation or hillock of snow.
There, with their Eagle in their midst, they
stood at bay, refusing to retire without direct
orders from their marshal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISOLATED AND SURROUNDED</div>

<p>Marbot, in his memoirs, describes the fate of
the 14th, to which he was sent with a message from
Napoleon. He was one of Augereau’s aides de
camp. It was just after the wounded marshal
had been carried back to the churchyard of the
village of Eylau, the centre of the French position,
whence Napoleon, on horseback, among his
personal suite, had witnessed the disaster. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
could see the 14th standing there, isolated and
surrounded; “we could see that the intrepid
regiment, surrounded by the enemy, was brandishing
the Eagle in the air, to show that it still
held its ground and wanted help.” Napoleon,
“touched by the grand devotion of these brave
men, resolved to try to save them. He gave
orders that an officer should be sent to tell
them to try to make their way back towards
the army. Cavalry would charge out to help
them. It looked,” says Marbot, “almost impossible
to get through the thronging Cossacks;
but Napoleon’s command had to be obeyed.”</p>

<p>“A brave captain of engineers named Froissart,
who, though not an aide de camp, was on
Augereau’s staff, happened to be nearest him,
and was told to carry the order to the 14th.
Froissart galloped off: we lost sight of him in
the midst of the Cossacks, and never saw him
again or heard what became of him. The marshal,
seeing that the 14th did not move, then sent
an officer named David. He had the same fate
as Froissart; we never heard of him again.
Probably both were killed and stripped, and could
not be recognised among the many corpses which
covered the ground. For the third time the
marshal called, ‘The officer for duty!’ It was
my turn.”</p>

<p>Marbot had seen his two predecessors go off
with their swords drawn, as though they intended
to defend themselves against attacks on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
way. He had remarked that, and now proposed
another method for himself.</p>

<p>“To attempt defence was madness; it meant
stopping to fight amidst a multitude of enemies.
I went otherwise to work. Leaving my sword
in its scabbard, I considered myself rather as a
rider who is trying to win a steeple-chase and
goes as quickly as possible by the shortest line
towards the appointed goal without troubling
about what is to right or left of his path. My
goal was the hillock on which stood the 14th,
and I resolved to get there without taking
heed of the Cossacks. I tried to put them out
of my mind entirely. The plan answered to perfection.”</p>

<p>“Lisette [Marbot’s charger], flying rather
than galloping, moving more lightly than a
swallow, darted over the intervening space,
leaping the heaps of dead men and horses, the
ditches, the broken gun-carriages, the half-extinguished
bivouac fires. Thousands of Cossacks
swarmed over the plain. The first who caught
sight of me behaved like sportsmen who, while
beating, start a hare and tell of its whereabouts
to each other with shouts of ‘Your side!’
None of the Cossacks tried to stop me. Perhaps
it was because of the amazing speed of my
mare; perhaps—probably—because there were
so many of them swarming round that each
thought I could not escape from his comrades
farther on. At any rate I got through them all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
and without scratch either to myself or to my
mare, and managed to reach where the 14th
stood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“AT LAST I WAS IN THE SQUARE!”</div>

<p>“I found them in square on top of their
hillock, but the slope all round was very slight,
and the Russian cavalry had been able to attack
them with several charges. All, though, had
been beaten off, and the regiment stood surrounded
by a circle of dead horses and dragoons.
The corpses indeed formed a kind of rampart
round our men, and made by now their position
almost inaccessible to mounted men. So I
found, for in spite of the help of our men, I had
much difficulty in getting across this horrible
entrenchment. At last, however, I was in the
square.”</p>

<p>The major of the 14th was the senior officer
left alive, and to him Marbot gave Napoleon’s
order. But it was absolutely impossible to
carry it out; there were too few men left to
make the attempt possible. They would be
overpowered, said the major to Marbot, before
they had gone half a dozen steps. They were
past hope now, unless the cavalry could cut
their way to them at once. Marbot must save
himself and get back at once. He must take
their Eagle back with him and deliver it into
Napoleon’s own hands. “I see no means left
of saving the regiment,” were the major’s words.
“Return to the Emperor, and bid him farewell
from the 14th of the Line. We have faithfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
obeyed his orders in defence of the Eagle. Bear
him back his Eagle which he entrusted to us,
which now we have no hope of defending longer.
It would add too much to the bitterness of death
for us to see it fall into the hands of the enemy.”
The major handed the Eagle to Marbot and
then saluted it, amid shouts of “Vive l’Empereur!”
from the men round.</p>

<p>Marbot took the Eagle, and, as the only means
of preserving it during his ride back, tried to
break it off from its stout pole so as to conceal
it under his cloak. He was in the act of leaning
forward to get a purchase in order to break
the oaken staff, when he was suddenly rendered
powerless by the wind of a grape-shot. It was
a marvellous escape from death. The shot
actually went through his hat, within a quarter
of an inch of his head. It deprived him, as he
describes, of all power and sensation, although
he still remained fixed in his saddle, his eyes
witnessing the last scene, the fate of the 14th.
The square was finally rushed by a swarm of
Russian grenadiers, as Marbot says, who came
charging up to the spot—“big men with mitre-shaped
caps bound in brass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIGHTING TO THE LAST MAN</div>

<p>“These men hurled themselves furiously on
the feeble remains of the 14th. Our poor
fellows had little strength left for resistance,
weakened as they were by hardships and
privations. They had for days been only existing
on potatoes and melted snow, and on that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
morning had not had time to prepare even that
wretched meal. Yet they made bravely what
fight they could with their bayonets, and when,
as too soon happened, the square was broken,
they tried to hold together in groups, fighting
back to back and keeping up the unequal fight
to the last man.”</p>

<p>Those nearest Marbot, so as not to be bayoneted
from behind, stood all round him with their
backs to the mare, hemmed in by a ring of Russians,
some shooting down the hapless Frenchmen,
others killing them with the bayonet.</p>

<p>Marbot, recovering his senses, got at the last
moment an unexpected chance of escape. His
mare, Lisette, he says, “of a notoriously savage
temper,” was pricked by a bayonet apparently,
for she suddenly sprang forward, lashing out and
kicking and biting. She crashed through the
nearest Russians and galloped off with Marbot
on her back towards Eylau. He was mistaken
by the Cossacks, he thought, for a Russian officer,
and rode on until suddenly Lisette collapsed
beneath him, and Marbot rolled off into the
snow, where he lay insensible for some hours.
He lay there until a marauder on the field after
the battle tried to strip him of his gold-laced
uniform. That roused him, and he cried for help,
which came; but the Eagle of the 14th had
disappeared.</p>

<p>Two Eagles of St. Hilaire’s division of Soult’s
corps were taken at about the same time that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
the 14th met its fate. One was that of the
10th Light Infantry, ridden down while hastening
forward to support Augereau. The 10th
missed its way in the snow-storm and, blundering
close under the Russian guns, was “decimated
by grape.” Immediately after that,
while reeling under the shock, and trying to
re-form its ranks, the Russian dragoons dashed
into it. They burst into its midst at full
gallop, “unseen until they were actually
among us.” No help was near, and in less than
three minutes the luckless 10th Light Infantry
had ceased to exist. The second of Soult’s
Eagles that was lost at Eylau was that of a
battalion of the 28th of the Line, which also
perished, victims to the sabres of the Russian
horsemen. It was a little later in the day, just
after the 28th had made a successful bayonet
charge on the Russian infantry. They were in
the midst of their combat when the dragoons
dashed into them, rode through them, and
scattered them, bearing off the Eagle, snatched
from the hands of the Eagle-bearer, who was cut
down in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE FIRST GRENADIER OF FRANCE”</div>

<p>The Heart of the “First Grenadier of France”
nearly went to St. Petersburg at the same time,
The 46th and 28th together formed General
Levasseur’s division in Soult’s corps, and both
were overwhelmed at the same time by the
Russian dragoons. The more fortunate 46th
saved both their Eagle and the silver casket<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
in which the heart of La Tour d’Auvergne was
kept enshrined. The casket was worn, strapped
on a velvet shield, on the chest of the senior
grenadier sergeant of the First Battalion, whose
station was next the Eagle-bearer. It was with
the 46th, then known as the 46th Demi-Brigade,
that the heroic “Premier Grenadier de France”
was serving as a captain when he met his death
in the year of Hohenlinden, while in the act of
capturing an Austrian standard. The 46th of
the Line of the modern French Army keeps up
to-day the traditional practice, first ordered by
Moreau, the victor of Hohenlinden, of calling
his name first of all at regimental parades.
It was revived some thirty years ago, after being
in desuetude since 1809. “Immediately the
Colonel has saluted the flag,” describes one of
the officers of the regiment, “the Captain commanding
the colour-company steps forward and,
facing the men, calls in a loud voice ‘La Tour
d’Auvergne,’ on which the senior sergeant of
the company steps out two paces and replies,
in a loud voice also, ‘Mort au Champ d’Honneur!’—‘Dead
on the Field of Honour!’”</p>

<p>The heart of La Tour d’Auvergne in its silver
casket was ceremoniously deposited by the
regiment at the Invalides in 1904, eight years
ago.</p>

<p>The 25th of the Line saved its Eagle, but lost
on the field every single one of its officers. A
plainly built obelisk with the brief inscription,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
“To the Memory of the Officers of the 25th,”
was erected by Napoleon to commemorate their
fate at Eylau.</p>

<p>Two Eagles of Davout’s corps were lost at
Eylau. One was that of the 18th—the sole
loss of an Eagle in the battle, as it so happens,
that it suited Napoleon’s purpose to admit
publicly. This is what he said of it in his
Eylau Bulletin—the 58th Bulletin of the Grand
Army:</p>

<p>“The Eagle of one of the battalions of the
18th Regiment is missing. It has probably
fallen into the hands of the enemy, but no reproach
can attach to this regiment in the predicament
in which it was placed. It is a mere
accident of war. The Emperor will give the
18th another Eagle when it has taken a standard
from the enemy.”</p>

<p>Comments on this, by the way, a British
officer, Colonel Sir Robert Wilson, who was
attached to the Russian army as British military
commissioner:</p>

<p>“Admirable! the accidental loss of <em>one</em> Eagle
and only one! Colonel Beckendorff, then, did
not carry <em>twelve</em> Eagles (and, moreover, several
colours from which the Eagles had been unscrewed)
to Petersburg, where they now are for
the inspection of the world!”</p>

<p>Napoleon made no other open reference to
the loss of Eagles at Eylau; but, as he showed
a little later, he felt what had happened. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
other hand, outside France, many people disbelieved
the Russian official despatches. “The
number of Eagles said to be taken,” wrote the
editor of a London newspaper, “is astounding,
indeed incredible.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO MORE EAGLES LOST</div>

<p>The 18th lost their Eagle in the fierce fighting
on the extreme right of the battlefield, where,
after storming the village of Serpallen, Morand’s
division captured a Russian battery, bayoneting
the gunners. As they took the guns a Russian
cavalry brigade came hastening to the spot to
the rescue. Taking the 18th on the flank, the
Russians rode them down, breaking the regiment
up and scattering it. The Eagle disappeared
in the midst of the fight. The Eagle
of the 51st of the Line was the other that was
lost in Davout’s corps. That was taken by the
Prussian division which fought at Eylau; the
last remnant of the Jena army still combating
in the field. The Prussians, some 12,000 in
number, had made good their escape to the
Polish frontier and reached the battlefield of
Eylau at the close of the fight, in time to
strike in and take vengeance for their countrymen.
They were, however, deprived in the end
of their trophy. The captured Eagle of the
51st was claimed from them by the Russian
general after the battle, and sent with the eleven
others to St. Petersburg, where it now is.</p>

<p>Two others of Davout’s Eagles which came
through at Eylau had narrow escapes. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
were those of the 17th and 30th of the Line.
The 17th was one of the regiments ridden down
by Towazysky’s dragoons, the troopers who
carried off the Eagle of the 18th. In their
charge the dragoons broke up the 17th as well,
and the Eagle was left with only a few men
near by to defend it. They were in the midst
of the dragoons as the Russians galloped through,
slashing with their sabres at all within reach.
As the only means of saving the Eagle, Locqueneux,
a <i lang="fr">fourrier</i>, or quartermaster-sergeant,
“thrust the Eagle under the snow and stood
on it shouting for help. Colonel Mallet heard
the cry and ran to the rescue. With a few men
who rallied to the spot he succeeded in getting
the Eagle away from among the <i lang="fr">débris</i> of the
17th.” At roll-call next morning only one
man in five answered to his name. Napoleon,
on his ride over the field, happening to pass by
while the muster was being held, the gallant
<i lang="fr">fourrier</i> was brought before him and presented
with a lieutenant’s commission and an annuity
of 2,000 francs. The Eagle of the 30th of the
Line, another of Morand’s regiments, was saved
from capture in like manner by the personal
devotion of another <i lang="fr">fourrier</i>, Morin by name.
All round him men were falling, and he himself
had been severely wounded, but the brave
fellow had just strength enough to bury the
Eagle under the snow. He fainted from loss
of blood as he did it. Morin was found next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
morning just alive, outstretched over where
the precious Eagle lay concealed. He was able
to make signs and indicate that it was lying
underneath the snow, and then he died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUR CUIRASSIER EAGLES TAKEN</div>

<p>Four cavalry Eagles, those of cuirassier regiments,
made up the tale of twelve lost by
Napoleon in the two days at Eylau. Platoff’s
Cossacks of the Don captured the four. They
swooped down on Murat’s cavalry, while out of
hand and partially dispersed after breaking
through the Russian centre, at the close of
Murat’s desperate charge at the head of seventy
squadrons to save the survivors of the massacre
of Augereau’s ill-fated battalions. Of one cuirassier
regiment only 18 men managed to regain
their own lines, leaving 530 of their comrades
on the field to be stripped of their shining
armour by the Cossacks.</p>

<p>The Eagle of the Old Guard led a charge at
Eylau at the head of the Grenadiers. The Guard
came into action to beat back a daring Russian
counter-attack on the centre of Napoleon’s
position, which immediately followed the annihilation
of Augereau’s corps. Napoleon himself
gave the order for the Guard to go forward.
“The Emperor,” describes Caulaincourt, who
was on Napoleon’s staff, and near him throughout,
“standing erect in the stirrups, his glass
at his eye, was the first to realise that the black
shadow steadily drawing near through the veil
of the snow-storm must be the columns of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
Russian reserve.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> He immediately sent against
them two battalions of the Grenadiers of the
Guard commanded by General Dorsenne.” It
was just after Murat had been ordered to
make his charge.</p>

<p>Dorsenne—“Le Beau Dorsenne,” he was universally
called; he had the reputation of being
the handsomest man in the whole of the Grand
Army—started off on the instant, rapidly
deploying his men into lines as he moved forward,
and with the Eagle of the Grenadiers of
the Guard in advance of the centre of the front
line. The Old Guard moved out in stately
order, marching with clockwork precision, muskets
at the support—held erect at the side and
steadied and supported with one arm held
stiffly across. One of the officers who rode
beside Dorsenne suggested to the general as
they were nearing the Russians to open fire.
“Non!” was the haughty answer. “Grenadiers
l’arme à bras! La Vieille Garde ne se
bât qu’à la baïonette!” (“No! Arms at the
support! The Old Guard only fights at the
point of the bayonet!”)</p>

<p>They reached the Russians, who, on their side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
seemed for the moment as if spellbound at the
sight of them. The nearest Russians stopped
short. They stood stock-still, rooted in the
ground as it were, gazing at the sudden apparition
of the solid wall of 2,000 veteran giants in
their huge towering bear-skins. The next instant
the battalion guns of the Guard, which
accompanied the advance on either flank, opened
with a burst of fire at short range into the thick
of the Russians. At once, down came the
gleaming rows of bayonets, and, like one man,
the Old Guard sprang forward and charged into
the enemy. A moment before the bayonets
crossed a squadron of the Chasseurs of the
Guard, the men on duty as Napoleon’s own
personal escort, sent forward by the Emperor
himself to assist the Grenadiers, dashed into the
rear of the Russian column, and “drove it forward
on our Grenadiers, who received it with
fixed bayonets.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLE OF THE OLD GUARD</div>

<p>Just before that it was that the Eagle of the
Old Guard had its adventure. A shell dropped
right in front of it and burst. The fragments
smashed the Eagle pole in two places, just above
and below the hands of the Eagle-bearer. The
Eagle fell to the ground at the feet of the Russians.
But they had not time to get hold of it.
Instantly Lieutenant Morlay, the Eagle-bearer,
sprang forward and recovered it. Picking the
Eagle up, with the flag and fragment of pole
that was left, Morlay snatched hold of a grenadier’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
musket and jammed the piece of the staff
into the muzzle beside the bayonet. He carried
the Eagle in that manner throughout the rest of
the battle.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AT MIDNIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE</div>

<p>A hundred and fifty thousand combatants had
faced one another at daybreak. An hour before
midnight, when the last shots were fired, 50,000
men lay dead or wounded on the field. “Never,”
if we may recall the grim picture of the scene
next day that Alison has drawn, “was spectacle
so dreadful as that field presented on the following
morning. Above 50,000 men lay in the
space of two leagues, weltering in blood. The
wounds were, for the most part, of the severest
kind, from the extraordinary quantity of cannon-balls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
which had been discharged during the action
and the close proximity of the contending masses
to the deadly batteries, which spread grape at
half-musket shot through their ranks. Though
stretched on the cold snow and exposed to the
severity of an Arctic winter, the sufferers were
burning with thirst, and piteous cries were heard
on all sides for water, or assistance to extricate
the wounded men from beneath the heaps of
slain or load of horses by which they were
crushed. Six thousand of these noble animals
encumbered the field, or, maddened with pain,
were shrieking aloud amidst the stifled groans
of the wounded. Broken gun-carriages, dismounted
cannon, fragments of blown-up caissons,
scattered balls, lay in wild confusion amidst
casques, cuirassiers, and burning hamlets, casting
a livid light over a field of snow. Subdued by
loss of blood, tamed by cold, exhausted by
hunger, the foemen lay side by side, amidst the
general wreck. The Cossack was to be seen
beside the Italian; the gay vine-dresser from
the banks of the Garonne lay athwart the stern
peasant from the plains of the Ukraine.”</p>

<p>When Napoleon took his ride over the field,
“the men exhibited none of their wonted enthusiasm;
no cries of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ were
heard; the bloody surface echoed only with the
cries of suffering or the groans of woe.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “TEMPLE OF VICTORY”</div>

<p>Sixteen Russian standards were sent to Paris
after Eylau; Napoleon’s set-off to the twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Eagles taken to St. Petersburg. They were to
be hung, he directed, temporarily at the Invalides,
until such time as the conversion of the
former Church of the Madeleine into Napoleon’s
grandiose “Temple of Victory” should be
effected—a project that was fated never to be
accomplished. There, designed Napoleon, all
the trophies of the Grand Army would find their
final resting-place, in a splendid edifice, designed
externally after the Parthenon at Athens.
Within, the trophies would be displayed, amidst
colonnades of Corinthian pillars of marble and
granite and a mass of decorative sculptures,
statues of marshals and generals who had met
their death in battle, and bas-reliefs of famous
colonels, before a lofty marble curule chair,
which Napoleon would occupy as a throne on
great occasions. “It is a Temple I desire,” he
laid down, writing from his camp in Poland, “not
a church; and everything must be made in a
chaste, severe, and durable style, and be suitable
for solemnities at all times and all hours.”</p>

<p>Two more Eagles had yet to go to St. Petersburg
before the war was over—the Eagle of the
15th of the Line and another. They were the
spoils that the beaten Russian army carried off
from the battle of Friedland, fought some six
months after Eylau, on July 14. Napoleon
won one of his most famous victories at Friedland,
and one that he afterwards recorded on the
colours of all the regiments that fought in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
battle; but the defeated army carried back with
them two more of his Eagles.</p>

<p>The Eagle of the 15th of the Line, a regiment
of Marshal Ney’s corps, was lost in a bayonet
charge while fighting the Russian Imperial
Guard. The second Eagle was left among the
dead in the repulse of a column of Marshal
Lannes’ corps in the earlier part of the battle.
“A column of 3,000 men advanced straight
against Friedland. They were permitted to approach
close to the Russian cannon without a
single shot being fired, when suddenly the whole
opened with grape, and with such effect that in
a few minutes a thousand men were struck down,
the column routed, and the Eagle taken.”</p>

<p>One of the regiments of the column saved
itself as it fell back by rallying round its Eagle.
As at Eylau, so at Friedland the Russian dragoons
dashed down among the broken battalions
while trying to re-form under the murderous
cannonade. The 50th of the Line had been near
the head of the column, and more than half of
its men had been shot down. The dragoons were
cutting their way through to the Eagle, when
Adjutant Labourie snatched it from its wounded
bearer, and, holding it up, shouted to the men:
“Rally round the Eagle. We must defend it
to the death!” A small square hastily formed
round him, and, stubbornly resisting, they kept
the Russian dragoons off and fought their way
back to safety with the Eagle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">GOLDEN WREATHS FOR THE EAGLES</div>

<p>The Peace of Tilsit closed the war within a
month of Friedland.</p>

<p>The welcome-home of Paris to the Old Guard,
and public decoration of the Eagles with crowns
of gold, was the curtain-scene and grand <i lang="fr">finale</i>
of the Jena-Friedland drama. To all the regiments
of the Grand Army under fire at Jena,
Friedland, and Eylau, wreaths of gold, to be
affixed round the necks of their Eagles, were
voted by the Municipality of Paris. The wreaths
were to be publicly presented to each regiment
on its return to France.</p>

<p>The Guard were the first to receive theirs, and
their arrival in the capital was made the occasion
of a series of civic fêtes; announced
officially as being “offered in tribute to the
Glory of the Grand Army.” Wednesday,
November 25, 1807, was the day on which the
Guard were due to reach Paris. All had been
made ready to accord them a magnificent reception.</p>

<p>The Prefect of the Seine, at the head of the City
magistrates and the Municipal Councillors of
Paris, all in their robes and chains and glittering
insignia of office, escorted by a mounted cohort
of National Guards, met the returning veterans
at the Barrier on the Strasburg road. Marshal
Bessières led the Guard, who marched up with
bands playing and resplendent in their full-dress
uniforms, horse and foot and artillery—12,000
men in all. A gigantic triumphal arch was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
set up beyond the Barrier, wide enough for
twenty men to march through abreast. It was
the approach to a wide arena on which the troops
drew up, massed in front of a lofty platform,
decked out with flags and wreaths of evergreens
and bright-coloured hangings. There the Prefect
took his place with his <i lang="fr">entourage</i> as the
soldiers drew near. Grand-stands to accommodate
a crowd of sightseers surrounded the
arena.</p>

<p>The Old Guard marched in and drew up in
close order, on which the proceedings opened
with the civic address. “Heroes of Jena, of
Eylau, of Friedland,” began the Prefect, “conquerors
of a splendid peace, immortal thanks are
your due from France! We salute you, Eagles
of war, the symbols of the might of our noble-hearted
Emperor! You have made known
throughout the world, with his great name, the
glory of victorious France!” So, in grandiloquent
style, the address commenced. At its close
the regiments of the Guards defiled past the
platform in turn—Carabineers and Cuirassiers,
Chasseurs, Dragoons, and Hussars, and the battalions
of veteran Grenadiers. Round the neck
of each Eagle, as its corps came up, the Prefect
hung a wreath of laurel-leaves in gold.</p>

<p>Then came the triumphal march through the
streets of Paris to the Tuileries, amid cheering
crowds, nearly beside themselves with excitement
and enthusiasm, and with difficulty kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
back from breaking through the rows of National
Guards who lined the pavement, to hug
the grim bearskin-hatted warriors. The Eagles
deposited with ceremony in the Imperial Guardroom
of the Palace of the Tuileries, the horsemen
dismounted in the Square of the Carrousel,
muskets were piled, and all marched off
to the Champs Elysées. An immense banquet
awaited them there, under vast marquees—shelter
that the men appreciated, for it turned
out a miserably wet afternoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BANQUETED BY THE CITY OF PARIS</div>

<p>The banquet in the Champs Elysées was the
first in the round of festivities with which Paris
welcomed home the “Victors over Europe.”

in a grand reception given by the Senate to all

<h3 id="toclink_181"><span class="smcap">The “Eagle-Guard”</span></h3>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> loss of twelve Eagles in one battle made a
deep and lasting impression upon Napoleon.
That twelve of his cherished emblems, those
mementoes of victorious Caesar, for whose prestige
he had advanced such exacting claims, should
have fallen <i lang="fr">en bloc</i> into the hands of the enemy
came as a galling blow to Napoleon’s military
pride. Twelve Eagles reft from amid the bayonets
of the Grand Army on one battlefield: twelve
Eagles paraded together as trophies through the
capital of an exulting foe! It was a poignantly
felt humiliation for the mighty Imperator of the
Field of Mars. And yet no default could be
charged against the soldiers to whom these
Eagles had been entrusted. All that men might
do for their defence they had done. Most of
the luckless battalions, indeed, had fought and
fallen directly under the eyes of the Emperor
himself, looking on from his post of vantage
by the wall of Eylau churchyard.</p>

<p>Napoleon, however, had already realised that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
his distribution of an emblem to whose preservation
he attached such extreme importance
had been made on too lavish a scale. He had been
imprudent in distributing such hostages to
fortune broadcast; there were too many Eagles
on offer to the enemy. Napoleon, indeed, had
already tacitly admitted that. Within two
months of the opening of the first campaign of
the Grand Army—during the Austerlitz campaign—immediately
after Murat’s daring gallop
on Vienna, Napoleon had summarily directed all
the light cavalry Eagles to be sent back from
the front. Every Hussar and Chasseur regiment
was ordered to return its three squadron
Eagles to head-quarters forthwith, for sending
back to France. In future, a new Army regulation
laid down, those corps would not take their
Eagles into the field at all. The regulation after
that was extended to Dragoons; and later to
all Light Infantry battalions. No doubt it was
a step dictated by prudence. In these corps
particularly, from the nature of the duties they
had normally to perform, the Eagles were
peculiarly exposed to risk of isolation and
capture.</p>

<p>What had happened at Eylau, and several
narrow escapes in hand-to-hand combats at
Friedland, together with certain other incidents
in that battle which had come under Napoleon’s
personal notice, where, through a nervous anxiety
for the safety of their Eagles, some battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
commanders had kept back round them men
whose bayonets were badly wanted elsewhere,
led to a further step. Napoleon took advantage
of the general scheme for the reorganisation of
the Grand Army, which he carried out in 1808,
to recast entirely his original arrangement as
to the Eagles. He reduced the numbers by two-thirds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO MORE BATTALION EAGLES</div>

<p>Battalion Eagles were to be withdrawn in
favour of Regimental Eagles. In the infantry,
under the reorganisation scheme, there were to
be five battalions to each regiment instead of
three as heretofore; but there would be only
one Eagle in future for the entire regiment.
The existing Second and Third battalions were
ordered to give up the Eagles they had hitherto
carried, which would find a resting-place at the
Invalides. The Regimental Eagle would be borne
by the First Battalion. The other battalions
would carry only “fanions,” small pennon-shaped
flags. Each would have one “fanion,” a
plain serge flag, of a distinctive colour for each
battalion, without any mark or device on it,
beyond the number of the battalion.</p>

<p>The Imperial edict, issued early in 1808, laid
down that for the special protection of the
Regimental Eagle in battle a commissioned officer
and two picked veterans were to be appointed
as the “Eagle-Guard,” replacing the sergeant-major
and escort of the Battalion Eagles. The
three were to be known as the First, Second, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Third Eagle-Bearers or “Porte-Aigles.” The
officer to whose special charge the Regimental
Eagle itself was committed was to be a senior
lieutenant, “a man of proved valour, with not
less than ten years’ Army service, including
service on the battlefield in four campaigns,”
specified as those of Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, and
Friedland. He would receive captain’s pay, and
wear a gold-laced cocked hat and gold epaulettes.
The two other Porte-Aigles were to be, in
Napoleon’s own words, “deux braves,” of ten
years’ service in the ranks, and “non-lettrés.”
On the last qualification, indeed, Napoleon laid
peculiar stress. The two were to be, as the
Emperor himself put it, “men who could neither
read nor write, so that their only hope of promotion
should be through acts of special courage
and devotion.” They would receive lieutenants’
pay, have special privileges, and wear
four gold lace chevrons on their arms. Only the
Emperor could nominate or degrade Porte-Aigles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PENNONS TO FRIGHTEN HORSES</div>

<p>The Second and Third Porte-Aigles were to
carry no weapons except heavy pistols, “to blow
out the brains of an enemy attempting to lay
hands on an Eagle.” These were Napoleon’s
own words as to that, in his order of February 18,
1808: “Pour éviter que l’ardeur dans la mêlée ne
les détourne de leur unique objet, de la garde
de l’Aigle, le sabre et l’épée leurs sont interdits.
Ils n’auront d’autres armes que plusieurs paires
de pistolets, d’emploi que de veiller froidement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
a brûler la cervelle de celui qui avancerait la
main pour saisir l’Aigle.” After the Wagram
campaign of 1809 Napoleon substituted a helmet
and defensive brass scale-epaulettes as the
First Porte-Aigle’s equipment. He gave the two
soldiers of the Eagle-Guard a halberd each, with
a pennon or banderol attached—Red for the
Second Porte-Aigle, White for the Third—as well
as a sword and a pair of large-bore pistols. The
pennons were for use should mounted men attack
the Eagle; “for fluttering in front of the horses
in order to make them rear and plunge and upset
their riders.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Two more soldiers were added to the Eagle-Guard
in 1813, as the Fourth and Fifth Porte-Aigles.
They were armed with the same
weapons as the others, and had respectively
Yellow and Green pennons on their halberds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>Yet further to add to the prestige of the
Eagles, Napoleon, after Wagram, decreed the
institution of a Special Order of Military Merit,
which he called the “Order of the Trois Toisons
d’Or”—something on the lines of our own
Victoria Cross—certain of the provisions of
which had direct reference to the Eagles. The
decoration was to be conferred on men, whatever
their rank, “distinguished in the defence of
the Eagle of their regiment.” Also, according to
the 6th Article of the Constitution of the Order,
“Les Aigles des régiments qui ont assisté avec
distinction aux grandes batailles seront décorés
de l’Ordre des Trois Toisons d’Or.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The special distinction of having the badge
of the Legion of Honour affixed to its Eagle as
a decoration to the regimental standard was in
1812 granted to one corps, the celebrated 57th.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
It was as a reward for magnificent intrepidity
displayed under the eyes of Napoleon at the
battle of Borodino. The 57th had at the same
time a further and unique mark of Imperial
regard awarded to it. Napoleon ordered that
a representation of the badge of the Legion of
Honour should be stamped on the uniform
buttons of the regiment. No corps of the Grand
Army, perhaps, had a finer fighting tradition
than this splendid regiment—the same “<i lang="fr">Terrible
57me qui rien n’arrête</i>,” of the Army of Italy;
which, too, as has been said, Napoleon singled
out for a special word of encouragement on the
morning of Austerlitz; calling to them as he
rode past, “You will remember to-day, Fifty-seventh,
how I once named you ‘Le Terrible’!”</p>

<p>But, with regard to the Regimental Eagles of
1808, even for Napoleon it was one thing to
decree the abolition of Battalion Eagles, and
another to obtain compliance with the order
that the surplus Eagles should be returned to
the War Minister for laying up at the Invalides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOME CORPS DID NOT OBEY</div>

<p>A number of second and third battalions of
regiments stationed at places out of the way of
direct Imperial inspection—in garrisons beyond
the frontiers, in subjugated countries, or in the
remaining overseas possessions of France—continued
for some time to evade the order recalling
their Eagles. No doubt, too, they were unwilling
to part with standards some of which had led
the corps under fire at Austerlitz and Jena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>Napoleon had to repeat his order of recall
twice: once during 1809; the second time in
1811. That second order was the outcome of a
discovery made by the Emperor himself. At an
Imperial review of the troops of the Amsterdam
and North Holland garrisons on October 12,
1810, three of the regiments had the temerity
to parade before the Emperor’s eyes with four
Eagles apiece—one to each battalion. Such
flagrant disobedience could not be overlooked;
and then subsequent inquiries brought out the
fact that elsewhere there were many Battalion
Eagles which had similarly been retained against
orders. An additional discovery was made at
the same time, that the Fourth-Battalion Eagles
had been supplied surreptitiously, through some
official at the Ministry of War, entirely without
Napoleon’s knowledge.</p>

<p>It made Napoleon excessively angry. He
complained bitterly to Marshal Berthier at the
way in which the department which had to do
with the standards of the Army had been mismanaged.
“La partie des drapeaux des régiments,”
he declared, “est aujourd’hui dans un
grand chaos.” To the Minister of War, General
Clarke, Duc de Feltre, Napoleon sent a stinging
letter of rebuke.</p>

<p>With the letter went the draft of yet another
decree, to be communicated to every corps in
the service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S FINAL ORDER</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“I only give,” wrote Napoleon now, “one
Eagle per regiment of infantry, one per
regiment of cavalry, one per regiment of
artillery, one per regiment of special gendarmerie.
None to the departmental companies
or guards of honour.</p>

<p>“No corps may possess an Eagle which
has not been bestowed by my own hand.</p>

<p>“All regiments, further, of whatever denomination,
if they did not receive the Eagle
they are authorised to possess from the
hand of the Emperor in person, either
directly on parade, or through a regimental
deputation, must return it to the Ministry
of War for the will of his Majesty to be
declared as to that Eagle.</p>

<p>“All other corps are to carry ‘fanions,’
ordinary flags. Infantry regiments reduced
below 1,000 men in strength, and cavalry
regiments of less than 500 men, cannot
retain their Eagle, and must return it
to the dépôt. They will be accorded a
standard [drapeau] without the Eagle.</p>

<p>“All the infantry regiments now in possession
of an Eagle per battalion, and cavalry
with one per squadron, are to send the
extra-regulation Eagles at once to Paris, to
be kept [<i lang="fr">déposées</i>] at the Invalides until
they can be placed in the ‘Temple of Glory’
[the Church of the Madeleine, then being
rebuilt].” “Jusqu’à ce qu’elles puissent être
misées dans le Temple de la Gloire,” was
what Napoleon wrote.</p>
</div>

<p>Three of the British trophy-Eagles now at
Chelsea, it may be remarked in passing, bear the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
number “82.” They came into our hands in
February 1809, at the surrender of Martinique
to a conjoint British military and naval expedition.
The 82nd was one of the regiments referred
to as out of the way of direct inspection;
in garrison across the Atlantic. It had not
obeyed the order of 1808 to return its Second
and Third Battalion Eagles to Paris—with the
result that three Eagles at Chelsea represent the
misfortune of this one regiment.</p>

<p>“The First Battalion,” ordered Napoleon in
his decree of 1811, “is to carry the Eagle: the
other battalions will have each a fanion, quite
plain, as follows: 2nd Battalion, White; 3rd,
Red; 4th, Blue. Where certain regiments may
possess additional battalions, these are to have,
the 5th a Green fanion, the 6th a Yellow fanion.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>In 1813, in Napoleon’s conscript army levied
to replace the host destroyed in Russia, the
newly raised Line regiments, and “Provisional-Regiments,”
made up of the amalgamated
dépôt battalions of various corps, had to earn
their Eagles on the battlefield. “No newly
raised regiment,” ordered Napoleon, “is to
receive an Eagle until after his Majesty has been
satisfied with its service before the enemy.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ONLY NAMES ALLOWED</div>

<p>The flags issued in 1808, and after that, to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
with the Regimental Eagles, were much more
elaborate than those of the Champ de Mars.
They had white diamond-shaped centre panels,
similar to those in the flags presented on the
Field of Mars, but with Imperial crowns embroidered
in gold on the red and blue upper
corners of the flag, and golden Eagles on the
lower corners. Gold embroidered wreaths of
laurel, encircling the Imperial monogram “N.”
divided off the crowns above from the Eagles
below. A border of gold fringe round the entire
flag, embroidered with bees, was another new
enrichment. In these flags the regimental battle-honour
inscriptions on the reverse side of the
white centre space in the former flags appeared
in a revised from. Only victories of importance
since the institution of the Empire, and at which
Napoleon had commanded in person, were admitted.
Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau, Friedland,
Eckmühl, Essling, Wagram, constituted
the full list from which selection was made. One
regiment alone was allowed to record an earlier
victory:—the Imperial Guard. They preserved
their “Marengo” honour. Inscriptions
such as “Le 75e arrive et bât l’ennemi,” “J’étais
tranquille, le 32e était là,” and the others
which had been allowed on the flags of the
Field of Mars, recalling deeds of the Army of
Italy, disappeared from the revised pattern of
1808. A new inscription was specially authorised
for the flag of one regiment, in honour of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
feat of great distinction during the Wagram
campaign. The 84th of the Line was permitted
to inscribe “Un contre dix—Grätz, 1809”—but
that only lasted for three years; the inscription
was ordered to be taken off in 1811.</p>

<p>The design of the flag introduced in 1808 held
until 1814. A less elaborate design was adopted
for the Eagle-standards of the “Hundred Days,”
two specimens of which are in this country—the
Waterloo trophies at Chelsea.</p>

<p>Attractive and handsome as the new flag was,
the Army, as before, looked on it as but an
appendage, as merely “l’ornement de l’Aigle.”
The Eagle at the head of the staff, by itself, was
all that nine soldiers out of ten troubled about.
Not a few regiments, indeed, when on service,
removed the flags altogether from their Eagle-poles
and displayed as their standard the Eagle
only. Particularly was this the case in Spain,
where many regiments were in the field continuously,
in some instances, for over six years—from
1808 to 1814. Asked one day after the
Peninsular War about the inscription and battle-honours
on the flag of his regiment, an infantry
<i lang="fr">chef de bataillon</i> frankly confessed that he had
“never set eyes on it!” The silken flag, he
explained, “had been removed from the Eagle-pole
before he first joined as a lieutenant, and
had always, as he understood, been kept at the
dépôt of the corps in France, rolled up and
locked away in the regimental chest. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
Eagle on its bare pole was all he had ever
seen.”</p>

<p>Said another officer: “We never spoke of the
regiment’s ‘colours,’ and never saw them. We
spoke only of ‘the Eagle.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHEN NAPOLEON MET AN EAGLE</div>

<p>This may be added. Napoleon was scrupulously
exact in showing respect to the Eagle of a regiment
whenever he passed one; whether on the
line of march, or in bivouac, under a sentry,
with the Eagle-Guard near at hand, resting
horizontally on a support of piled muskets with
bayonets fixed. If on horseback, Napoleon always
uncovered and bowed low; if on the line of
march, he sometimes stopped his carriage in
passing, and got out, saluted the Eagle, and said
a few words about the regiment’s battle record
to the Eagle-Guard.</p>

<p>Between the review on the Field of Mars in
1804 and the overthrow on the plains of Leipsic
in 1814 the number of regiments in the Grand
Army increased continuously, requiring the
presentation of many new Eagles. Forty-four
were presented in the period to the infantry
alone; to the regiments of the Line bearing
numbers from the 113th to 156th; besides others
to the regiments of the “Middle Guard” and
“Young Guard,” and to two additional regiments
of Cuirassiers. In every case Napoleon, in
accordance with the stipulation that he so insisted
on, made the presentation in person, with
his own hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>In not a few instances, indeed, the ceremony
took place on campaign; and for one of these
exceptionally interesting occasions we have
available the notes of an eye-witness. It was at
the presentation of the Eagle of the 126th Regiment
of the Line, in Germany, in 1813.</p>

<p>Napoleon made his appearance in his campaigning
uniform, the dark green undress of the
Chasseurs of the Guard, and mounted as usual on
a grey charger. His staff, all brilliant in full
dress, attended him. Approaching the scene
at a canter, they all slowed down to a walk as
they neared where the regiment stood, with its
battalions parading every available man, and
drawn up to form three sides of a hollow square.
The new Eagle, enveloped in the leather casing
in which it had been brought from France, lay
on a pile of drums on one flank of the First
Battalion, and a little in advance. The fourth,
or open, side of the square was for the Imperial
staff, who drew up there, while the Emperor by
himself rode into the middle of the square. As
Napoleon reined up, the regimental drums beat
the <i lang="fr">Appel</i>, and the officers of the regiment
stepped to the front, with swords at the carry,
and formed in line before the Emperor.</p>

<p>Marshal Berthier, Chief of the Head-quarter
Staff, then rode across to where the Eagle lay.
He dismounted to receive it at the hands of the
First Porte-Aigle, the Eagle being uncased at
the same time. Berthier saluted the Eagle;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
then, holding it erect with both hands, the
marshal bore it ceremoniously along in front of
the row of officers, who saluted with lowered
swords as the Eagle passed, the drums of the
regiment now beating a long roll. Halting close
in front of Napoleon, Berthier inclined the Eagle
forward in salute, and the Emperor, on his side,
uncovered and bowed in return. Then, drawing
his glove from his left hand, Napoleon raised his
hand and extended it towards the Eagle. He
held the reins, according to his custom, in his
right hand. Napoleon began his address to the
corps in a deep, impressive tone:</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT A PRESENTATION IN THE FIELD</div>

<p>“Soldiers of the 126th Regiment of the Line,
I entrust to you the Eagle of France! It is to
serve to you ever as your rallying-point. You
swear to me never to abandon it, but with life!
You swear never to suffer an affront to it for the
honour of France! You swear ever to prefer
death for it to dishonour! You swear!” The
last words were pronounced with a peculiar
stress, in a very solemn tone, with intense
energy.</p>

<p>Instantly the officers of the regiment replied.
Holding their swords on high, with one voice
they shouted: “We swear!”</p>

<p>The next moment the words were taken up
and repeated enthusiastically by the men:
“We swear!”</p>

<p>Berthier, on that, formally handed the Eagle
over to the colonel of the regiment, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Emperor, raising his hand to his hat in salute
to the Eagle, turned to rejoin the Staff and
ride off elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the afternoon before the three days’ battle
of Leipsic opened, on October 15, 1813, Napoleon,
on the Marchfeldt, in the very presence of the
enemy, presented with these formalities new
Eagles to three newly raised regiments.</p>

<span class="subhead">BEFORE THE ENEMY AT ASPERN AND WAGRAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Napoleon’s</span> regimental Eagles made their début
on the battlefield in the Wagram campaign of
1809, when Austria challenged Napoleon to a
second trial of strength in her premature attempt
to achieve the liberation of Germany. The gallant
deeds of the regiments that fought round
the Eagles in that war are commemorated on the
standards of the French Army to-day by the
legend “Wagram, 1809,” a name and date
that stand as the comprehensive memento of a
conflict that lasted four months, and included
no fewer than ten fiercely fought battles. They
are superabundant as a fact; it would almost
need a book by itself to tell the full story. It
must suffice therefore to take here only these,
picked out at random, as typical of the rest.</p>

<p>This is the achievement that “Wagram, 1809,”
inscribed in golden letters on the silken tricolor
standard of the present-day 65th of the Line,
serves to recall.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s 65th was one of the regiments of
Marshal Davout’s corps at Ratisbon, where
Davout had been stationed on the eve of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
outbreak of the war. He was hastily recalled
on the Austrians opening hostilities and advancing
in greatly superior force. Davout fell
back at once, leaving behind him the 65th to
hold the very important bridge over the Danube
at Ratisbon for forty-eight hours, until the
bulk of his corps had gained a sufficient start
on their way.</p>

<p>The 65th had not long to wait for the enemy.
Within twelve hours of the marshal’s retirement
the Austrians swooped down on Ratisbon to
seize the bridge. Two of their army corps led
the advance. One took possession of the city,
sending troops forward to secure the bridge.
Part of the other crossed the Danube in the
neighbourhood of the city in boats, in order to
cut off and capture the French troops left behind.
It was expected that in the presence of so overpowering
an enemy the single French regiment
holding the bridge would not venture to make
a serious defence. The Austrians did not know
the 65th.</p>

<p>To oppose the first comers three battalions of
the 65th barricaded and loopholed the houses
nearest the bridge on that side. The remaining
battalion held a fortified outwork, or bridge-head,
across the river.</p>

<p>For a whole day the battalions in the city
held the Austrians at bay, resisting desperately
in the streets and from house to house. Four
hundred Austrian prisoners, together with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Austrian regimental standard and three other
flags, testified to the way they did their duty.
The battalion holding the bridge-head on the
farther side of the river made meanwhile a no
less stubborn resistance and kept the enemy off
until nightfall. Then, however, it was found
that their ammunition was exhausted. The
three battalions fighting the city were by that
time in a no less desperate plight. They on
their side had been forced back to their last
defences among the houses immediately surrounding
the approach to the bridge. Still, though,
they kept up a fierce resistance, at the last using
cartridges taken from the cartouche-boxes of the
Austrian prisoners and their own dead and
wounded comrades. They held out until further
defence of the bridge was impossible, until
indeed further resistance at all was hopeless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW WERE THEY TO SAVE THE EAGLE?</div>

<p>But the regimental Eagle? What was to
become of that? The Eagle of the 65th must
at all cost be kept from being surrendered into
an enemy’s hands. What was to be done? At
first it was suggested that an officer, known to
be a good swimmer, should try to swim down
the river with it in the dark until he could land
safely on the farther bank, after which he should
do his best to make his way to wherever Napoleon
might be, there to render personally into his
hands the sacred Eagle. But the other surviving
officers were loth to part with their treasured
standard in that way. The risk of a man getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
through the Austrians who were swarming on
the other side of the Danube was considered too
great. It was then suggested to sink it in the
Danube, noting the spot, so as to be able to
fish it up again on some future day. Colonel
Coutard, in command of the 65th, however, was
against that. They might never be able, or have
time, to find it at the bottom of a deep and
swiftly flowing river like the Danube. He proposed
to conceal the Eagle in the ground, burying
it in some secret place. There it might without
difficulty be recovered later on and brought back
to France. The colonel’s proposal was assented
to, and then a further suggestion was made.
Their Eagle should be given a fitting shroud by
wrapping round it the captured Austrian flags
they had taken that afternoon. That would
preserve the trophies also for future days when
the fortune of war again favoured the regiment.
The idea was eagerly taken up, and the Eagle
was buried in a cellar, wrapped up in the Austrian
flags.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WRAPPED UP IN CAPTURED FLAGS</div>

<p>After that, at the very last, just as the Austrians
were about to launch another attack it
was impossible to withstand, Colonel Coutard
had the <i lang="fr">chamade</i> beaten, and the 65th surrendered.
They were granted, as they well deserved, the
honours of war, and were for the time being
confined under guard in the city. Their captivity,
however, was not for long. Their release
came about in a very few days on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Austrian troops hurriedly evacuating Ratisbon
before Napoleon’s triumphant advance.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> The
Eagle was now dug up, and Colonel Coutard,
with a deputation from the regiment, waited on
Napoleon on his arrival, to present the Eagle
before him, still wrapped up in the three captured
Austrian flags.</p>

<p>In recognition of the endurance that the 65th
had shown, the colonel was created a Baron of
the Empire; crosses of the Legion of Honour
were distributed broadcast among all ranks;
forty soldiers who had shown exceptional gallantry
in the fighting were, as a reward, specially
transferred to the Old Guard.</p>

<p>Such is the fine story that the battle-honour
“Wagram, 1809,” lettered in gold on the regimental
tricolor of the present-day 65th of the
Line in the French Army commemorates, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
care is taken that every young soldier on joining
is made acquainted with it.</p>

<p>Equally fine as an exploit, and yet more renowned
for the exceptional honour that Napoleon
paid to the Eagle of the regiment, was the
splendid heroism that the 84th of the Line
displayed at Grätz in Styria. That episode of
the campaign, indeed, is commemorated by a
double battle-honour on the flag of the 84th of
the modern French Army. Both “Wagram,
1809,” and “Un contre dix—Grätz, 1809”
are inscribed in golden letters on its tricolor.
Napoleon himself, as has been said, bestowed
the honour of the unique inscription on the
regimental flag. He had also the words “Un
contre dix” incised on the square tablet supporting
the Eagle itself. Here is the story of
the exploit as related by one of Napoleon’s
staff officers in the campaign, Colonel Lejeune:</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEPT OFF WITH THE BAYONET</div>

<p>“Amongst all these battles and victories
there was one action so remarkable and so brilliant
that I feel impelled to describe it here from
the accounts of eye-witnesses. During the
taking of Grätz by General Broussier, and when
the struggle was at its fiercest, Colonel Gambin
of the 84th Regiment was ordered, with two of
his battalions, to attack the suburb of St.
Leonard, where he made from four to five
hundred prisoners. This vigorous assault led
General Guilay on the enemy’s side to imagine
he had to deal with a whole army, and he hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
to the aid of the suburb with considerable forces.
Gambin did not hesitate to attack them, and he
took from them the cemetery of the Graben
suburb, but was in his turn invested by the
Austrian battalions, and found it impossible to
rejoin the main body of the French. He accepted
the situation, spent the whole of the
night in fortifying the cemetery and the adjoining
houses, and, his ammunition being exhausted,
he actually kept at bay some 10,000 assailants
with the bayonet alone, even making several
sorties to carry off the cartouches on the dead
bodies with which his attacks had strewn the
ground near the cemetery. General Guilay now
directed the fire of all his guns and five fresh
battalions on this handful of brave men, who had
already for nineteen hours withstood a whole
army. General Broussier was at last able to
send Colonel Nagle of the 92nd, with two battalions,
to the aid of the 84th. The enemy
vainly endeavoured to prevent the two regiments
from meeting. Colonel Nagle overthrew
every obstacle, got into the cemetery, and after
embracing each other the two officers, with their
united forces, flung themselves upon the Austrians,
took 500 of them prisoners, with two flags,
and carried the suburb of Graben by assault,
finding no less than 1,200 Austrian corpses in
the streets. When the Emperor heard of this
feat of arms, he was anxious to confer the greatest
distinction he could on the 84th Regiment, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
ordered that its banner should henceforth bear
in letters of gold the proud inscription, ‘One
against ten.’”</p>

<p>Seldom indeed did the soldiers of Napoleon
encounter a more determined enemy than the
Austrians proved themselves in the war of 1809.
At Aspern, the battle on the Danube near Vienna,
where Napoleon experienced his first defeat on
the Continent, more than one Eagle came within
an ace of being taken. The Eagle of the 9th of
the Line, for instance, to save it from what appeared
to be imminent capture, was actually
buried on the battlefield in the middle of the
fighting. “Our colonel,” wrote one of the men
of the 9th, “took the Eagle of the regiment,
pulled it from its staff, and, after digging a hole
in the ground with a pioneer’s tool, buried and
concealed there our rallying signal to prevent
it from falling into the enemy’s hands.” It was,
though, after all, an unnecessary precaution.
The hard-pressed 9th were rescued at the last
moment, whereupon the Eagle made its reappearance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VICTIMS OF A PANIC IN THE DARK</div>

<p>Three other Eagles, less fortunate, are now in
the Austrian Army Museum at Vienna; those
of the 35th of the Line and of the 95th and 106th.
The Eagle of the 35th was taken on the Italian
frontier near Lake Garda, in a surprise attack
at daybreak on the camp of the Viceroy, Eugène
Beauharnais, by the troops of the Archduke
John. The other two fell into Austrian hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
on the night of the opening attack at Wagram,
victims of a panic that suddenly seized one of
the French columns. It had led the attack on
the centre of the Austrian position with brilliant
success.</p>

<p>Two thousand prisoners and five standards
had been taken, and the French were advancing
exultantly, when the Austrians counter-attacked
with fresh troops, headed by the Archduke
Charles in person. The French resisted stubbornly,
and at first successfully. They held
their own until, in the midst of furious hand-to-hand
fighting, they were suddenly charged by
cavalry. It was late evening, and in the gathering
dusk a sudden panic seized a regiment on
the flank. The panic spread instantly to the
whole of the attacking column. All order was
lost forthwith. The soldiers gave way in confusion,
broke up, and went racing back headlong,
a mob of fugitives, down the steep ascent that a
few minutes before they had so gallantly won.
As they went back in a tumultuous rush, fresh
French troops, coming up to their support, “in
the darkness mistook the retreating host for
enemies and fired upon it; they, in their turn,
were overthrown by the torrent of fugitives.”
The Austrian prisoners taken in the advance
escaped, the captured Austrian standards were
recaptured, and two Eagles disappeared in the
dark amid the turmoil. Those are the two now
at Vienna.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>Fortunately for Napoleon the Austrian leaders
did not realise the smashing nature of the blow
they had dealt. The fate of Napoleon’s Empire
otherwise might have been decided on that
night. Unaware that the panic had “spread an
indescribable alarm through the French centre
as far as the tent of the Emperor, they stopped
the advance, sounded the recall, and fell back to
their original positions.”</p>

<p>Of the Eagle-bearers of four regiments at
Aspern, the 2nd, 16th, 37th, and 67th of the
Line, not one came through the day alive, but the
Eagles were saved. They were the four regiments
that took the village of Aspern and held it
all day and till after dark—12,000 men against
80,000 enemies. The village was the all-important
key of the battlefield. Its defence was
of supreme moment, for only part of Napoleon’s
army had been able to get across the Danube
as yet, the main bridge of boats having been
broken down and swept away.</p>

<p>They had seized Aspern at the outset, but had
been forced to fall back before an Austrian
counter-attack, returning after that to recapture
it, and hold it until the end.</p>

<p>Marshal Masséna led the onset that retook the
village. “The Austrians,” describes a French
officer, “had entered Aspern, and it was absolutely
necessary to dislodge them. Masséna
therefore, who had had all his horses killed,
marched on foot with drawn sword at the head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
of the Grenadiers of the Molitor division, forced
his way into the village, crowded as it was with
Austrians, drove them out, and pursued them
for some twelve or fourteen yards beyond the
houses. But here the French troops found
themselves face to face with the strong force
under Hiller, Bellegarde, and Hohenzollern,
advancing rapidly in their direction. It was
hopeless for the division to attempt to engage
such superior numbers in the open plain, so Masséna
recalled the pursuers, and ordered them to
hold Aspern. The enemy, ashamed apparently
of this first defeat, returned to the charge with
80,000 men and more than a hundred pieces
of cannon, which were soon pointed on the
village.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT BAY IN THE BURNING VILLAGE</div>

<p>It was impossible to stop the onrush of the
Austrians. In spite of every effort of Masséna,
who with his artillery “opened fire upon the
densely packed masses of men, every shot working
terrible havoc amongst them,” they swarmed
forward to the outskirts of the village. A
life-and-death struggle in defence began. “In
a very few minutes the village was completely
surrounded by troops; and hidden from view
in the dense clouds of smoke from the cannon,
the musketry, and the fires which at
once broke out, the combatants, almost suffocated
by the smoke, crossed bayonets without
being able to see each other; but neither
side gave way a step, and for more than an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
hour the terrible attack and desperate defence
went on amongst the ruins of the burning
houses.”</p>

<p>It was during the Austrian opening attack on
the outskirts of Aspern that at one point a
French regiment—the number of the regiment is
not given in any account—was forced apart from
the rest, and driven back in disorder beyond the
village. Its colonel was killed, and, though the
Eagle was kept from falling into the enemy’s
hands, the regiment fell back in confusion. Napoleon
witnessed the check and galloped to intercept
the troops as they were retreating. Riding
into the midst of the fugitives, he personally rallied
them, and then called angrily for the colonel.
There was no answer from any one, and in high
anger Napoleon again called for the colonel.
Then somebody made the reply that the colonel
was dead. “I know that!” answered Napoleon
sharply. “I asked where he was!” “We left him
in the village.” “What! you left your colonel’s
body in the hands of the enemy? Go back
instantly, find it, and remember that a good
regiment should always be able to produce both
its Colonel and its Eagle!” Napoleon’s stinging
rebuke did its work. The men at once re-formed
and turned back. Charging forward with a rush,
they forced their way through to where the
colonel had fallen and recovered the body.
Then they joined in with the other defenders
at the village, and did their duty to the end.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
The colonel’s body was brought back and laid
before Napoleon next morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHAL MASSENA UNDER FIRE</div>

<p>The fearful contest in Aspern went on until
four in the afternoon, by which time the Austrians
had succeeded in taking half the village.
They could not, however, get beyond that.
“Masséna still held the church and cemetery,
and was struggling to regain what he had lost.
Five times in less than three hours he took and
retook the cemetery, the church, and the village,
without being able to call to his aid the Legrand
division, which he was obliged to hold in reserve
to cover Aspern on the right and keep the enemy
from getting in on that side. Throughout this
awful struggle Masséna stood beneath the great
elms on the green opposite the church, calmly
indifferent to the fall of the branches brought
down upon his head by the showers of grape-shot
and bullets, keenly alive to all that was
going on, his look and voice, stern as the <i lang="la">quos
ego</i> of Virgil’s angry Neptune, inspiring all who
surrounded him with irresistible strength.”</p>

<p>Even when the sun went down “the struggle
was far from being over, and the awful battle
was still raging in the streets and behind the
walls of the village of Aspern. The enemy,
irritated at the stubborn resistance of so small a
body of troops, redoubled their efforts to dislodge
them before nightfall, and went on fighting
by the light of the conflagrations alone. The
history of our wars relates no more thrilling incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
than this long and obstinate struggle, in
which our troops, disheartened by the ever-fresh
difficulties with which they had to contend,
worn out by fatigue, and horrified by the carnage
round them, were kept at their posts by the
example and exhortations of Masséna and his
officers alone. General Molitor had lost some
half of his men, and the enemy were hurrying up
from every side. The struggle was maintained
under these terrible conditions until eleven
o’clock, when we remained masters of Aspern
and of the whole line between it and Essling.”</p>

<p>Five regiments of the French Army of to-day
commemorate a splendid Eagle-incident in the
name “Wagram, 1809,” on their colours; the
final charge of Macdonald’s column which saved
and decided the battle for Napoleon, besides
gaining a marshal’s bâton for the Scottish officer
who achieved the feat. That was on the final
battlefield of Wagram itself, the outcome of which
tremendous encounter settled the fate of the war.
It was the culminating event of the battle. The
crisis was at hand for both armies when the order
was given to Macdonald to go forward. On the
Austrian side the powerful and fresh corps of the
Archduke John was rapidly nearing the scene,
and the fortune of the day yet wavered in the
balance. Napoleon, as his last hope and final
effort to break the stubborn Austrian array of
the Archduke Charles’ host which still confronted
him, defiant still after ten hours of charges and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
counter-charges, holding out tenaciously in a
strong position, massed his reserves and sent
them at the centre of the Austrians, to press forward
in a vast column of closely formed battalions.
They went at the enemy with all the daring of
a forlorn hope.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MACDONALDS’S COLUMN ADVANCES</div>

<p>“Moving steadily forward through the wreck
of guns, the dead, and the dying, this undaunted
column, preceded by its terrific battery incessantly
firing, pushed on half a league beyond
the front at other points of the enemy’s line.
In proportion as it advanced, however, it became
enveloped in fire; the guns were gradually
dismounted or silenced, and the infantry
emerged through their wreck to the front. The
Austrians drew off their front line upon their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
second, and both, falling back, formed a sort
of wall on each side of the French column, from
whence issued a dreadful fire of grape and
musketry on either flank of the assailants. Still
Macdonald pushed on with unconquerable resolution:
in the midst of a frightful storm of
bullets his ranks were unshaken; the destiny
of Europe was in his hands, and he was worthy
of the mission. The loss he experienced, however,
was enormous; at every step huge chasms
were made in his ranks, whole files were
struck down by cannon-shot, and at length his
eight dense battalions were reduced to 1,500
men. Isolated in the midst of enemies, this
band of heroes was compelled to halt. The
Empire rocked to its foundations: it was the
rout of a similar body of the Guard at Waterloo
that hurled Napoleon to the rock of St. Helena.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BATTLE WON AT LAST</div>

<p>The five regiments which formed the spear-point
of the attack had paraded that morning
6,000 strong. They numbered now, the survivors,
less than 300. They were at the extreme
point of the advance, but were held fast and
unable to go farther. The enemy were on every
side of them, for in the last moments they had
pressed on beyond touch of the troops that were
following next. The Austrians saw their chance
to charge them and annihilate them before the
approach of French supports to the main column
could get near. But General Broussier, the
Brigadier in command of the leading troops,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
knew his work and his men. As they halted
he rapidly rallied the fragments of the nearest
regiments and formed them in a single square.
They drew up under the <i lang="fr">feu d’enfer</i> of cannon
and musketry, three deep in front, with, in the
centre, held up on high, the five Eagles of
the regiments; so as not to weaken the front,
the firing line, “the Eagles were held up only
by men who had been wounded.” Broussier
marked the massing of the Eagles in the midst;
and, as the firing round them for one moment
seemed to lull, raising his voice, he called out
for all to hear: “Soldiers, swear to die here
to the last man round your Eagles!” “Jurez
moi, soldats, de mourir tous, jusqu’au dernier,
autour de vos Aigles!” were the Brigadier’s
words. But there was fortunately no need for
all to die. At that moment reinforcing troops
came up, with the Young Guard at their head.
The column, on that, moved forward again with
a steady front, “and the Archduke, despairing
now of maintaining his position, when assailed
at the crisis of the day by such a formidable
accession of force in the now broken part of his
line, gave directions for a general retreat.”
The Eagles had done their part and the battle
of Wagram was won.</p>

<span class="subhead">“THE EAGLE WITH THE GOLDEN WREATH” IN LONDON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> are thirteen of Napoleon’s Eagles in
England, among the trophies of the British Army
at Chelsea Royal Hospital; or, to speak strictly,
twelve Eagles and a “dummy” Eagle, the later
reproduction of a very famous trophy, gone
now, unfortunately, to the melting-pot of a
thieves’ kitchen. It is with the dummy Eagle,
as it may be called for short, without disrespect
to its gallant custodians, and five of the twelve
Eagles at Chelsea, that we are for the immediate
moment concerned. That represents
the first of Napoleon’s trophies won by British
soldiers in hand-to-hand fight—the once celebrated
“Eagle with the Golden Wreath.”</p>

<p>The story opens on Saturday morning, May 18,
1811, a day that was a great occasion for Londoners.
For the first time, on that Saturday,
trophies taken from Napoleon were publicly
displayed in the British Capital, and no pains
were spared to make the most of the event.
An elaborate and dramatic ceremonial was
ordained for the occasion by the authorities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
at the instance of the Prince Regent. It was
like nothing else of the kind ever witnessed or
heard of in England before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT LONDON HAD SEEN BEFORE</div>

<p>On many another day in bygone times London
had been the scene of stately martial pageants
in which the victor’s spoils from many battlefields
were borne in triumph, amid blare of
trumpets and clash of drums, to be deposited
with due ceremony in their allotted resting-places.
So had it been when the Marlborough
trophies from Blenheim and Ramillies, the
captured flags from Dettingen, Louisburg, and
Minden, were borne along the crowded streets,
preceded by bands playing triumphant music
and accompanied by armed escorts of Foot and
Horse. Another Saturday, seventeen years before,
May 17, 1794, had been the last occasion
of trophy-flags being displayed in London,
when the captured French Republican standards
of the garrison of Martinique were publicly
carried through the streets by Life Guards and
Grenadiers, with the band of the First Guards
leading the way and the Tower guns booming
out an artillery <i lang="fr">feu de joie</i>, from St. James’s
Palace to St. Paul’s, to be received at the great
west doors of the Cathedral by the Dean and
Chapter, and laid up “as a lasting memorial
of the success of his Majesty’s Arms.” Some
of the flags then displayed hang in the Hall of
Chelsea Hospital to-day.</p>

<p>So, too, had it been in London in yet earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
times, in the far off, unhappy days of Civil War
in England, when the citizens of those periods,
in turn, saw the spoils of Bosworth, and of Marston
Moor and Naseby, of Worcester, Preston,
and Dunbar, paraded through their midst,
escorted by mail-clad men-at-arms, on the way
to be hung up exultingly in St. Paul’s Cathedral
or in Westminster Hall. With his own Royal
banners from Marston Moor and Naseby drooping
down overhead from the roof of Westminster
Hall, Charles the First faced his judges and heard
his fate. But never before in London had so
elaborately designed a ceremony attended the
display of trophies taken from any enemy, as
that planned for the <i lang="fr">Royal Depositum</i>, as it
was officially styled, of the first of the captured
Eagles of Napoleon to be received in England.</p>

<p>There was to be a special display of trophies
the London newspapers announced some days
beforehand. The newspapers had not spared
themselves in working up public interest. At
the outset they had told how, on the night of
March 24, Captain Hope, First A.D.C. to
General Graham, had arrived in London with
the Barrosa despatches and a “French Eagle
with a wreath of gold,” which, it was stated, “the
general trusted his aide de camp might be permitted
to lay at his Majesty’s feet.” Then
Londoners were informed that the Barrosa
Eagle was a trophy of unusual importance, and
was being kept at the War Office, to be presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
to the Prince Regent at the next <i lang="fr">levée</i>. It was
announced a week later that his Royal Highness
had been so desirous of seeing it at once,
that the War Minister, the Earl of Liverpool,
instead of waiting five weeks for the <i lang="fr">levée</i>, had
already presented it to the Prince at Carlton
House. On that came the official notification
that “the Eagle with the Golden Wreath,”
as the trophy was everywhere styled, together
with a number of other French trophies,
which had been previously received and had
been some time stored away at the War Office
pending instructions as to their disposal, would
be deposited in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall,
(now the Museum of the Royal United Service
Institution). “The <i lang="fr">Royal Depositum</i> ceremony
will be very grand, and the martial music appropriate
to the occasion, and as the orders have
been issued by direction of his Royal Highness
the Prince Regent, the Chapel will be thronged
with nobility.” So one journal notified; another
remarking that “in addition to the great
religious and military ceremony, an anthem is
to be performed after the manner of the Te
Deum.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A GRAND MARTIAL CEREMONY</div>

<p>Thus popular interest was aroused and kept
alive in advance, and the selected Saturday
morning proving fine and pleasant, with the
prospect of a genial and sunny forenoon, Londoners
turned out in large numbers to see the
show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span></p>

<p>To the Brigade of Guards it fell to carry out
the ceremony of the military reception of the
Eagles.</p>

<p>The “Parade in St. James’s Park,” which we
know now as the Horse Guards Parade, was the
appointed place for the display, and as the clock
struck nine the preliminaries opened with the
arrival of a large body of Guards’ recruits who
were to keep the ground. From quite an early
hour a crowd had been gathering there and
along the side of the Park. Soon afterwards
the first of the troops designated to attend the
ceremony began to arrive. These were several
companies of the First Guards and Coldstreamers
“in undress, with side arms.” They formed
line along either side of the parade-ground; on
one side “extending from the corner of the
Chancellor of the Exchequer’s garden to the
Egyptian gun”; on the opposite side, “from the
Admiralty towards the Park.” To right and
left of the archway under the Horse Guards
leading to Whitehall were drawn up the “recruiting
parties stationed in the Home District.”</p>

<p>At a quarter to ten came on the scene the
first of the actors in the day’s proceedings, the
“King’s Guard” of the day, “in their best
uniforms, and with sprigs of oak and laurel in
their hats.” Marching up, headed by the combined
bands of the First Guards and the Coldstreamers,
with the regimental colour of the First
Guards, they formed on the right, along the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
side of the square, facing towards the Horse
Guards. Following them, a few moments later,
came the picked detachment appointed as the
“trophy-escort,” furnished jointly by the
grenadier companies of the First Guards and
the Coldstreamers. All were in review-order full
dress, “wearing long white gaiters, with oak and
laurel leaves in their hats.” A captain of the
First Guards was in command; and the detachment
was made up of two subalterns, four
sergeants, and ninety-six rank and file. They
took post on the left of the King’s Guard. As
the trophy-escort halted, up came another detachment
of Guards, a hundred strong, with
the Life Guards; marching across the square
and through the Horse Guards archway to line
the way thence to the doors of the Chapel Royal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GETTING READY FOR THE PRINCES</div>

<p>Towards ten o’clock privileged spectators
were admitted within the square, “to stand at
an appointed spot”: several veteran generals,
“in their best uniforms and powdered,” as a
newspaper reporter remarks; Lord Liverpool
the War Minister; the Earl Marshal; the
Speaker; the Spanish and Portuguese Ambassadors,
both gorgeously attired; and “a number
of beautiful and elegant ladies of distinction.”</p>

<p>The Horse Guards clock struck ten, and as the
last clanging stroke died away “the authorities”
came clattering on to the ground on horseback:
Sir David Dundas, Commander-in-Chief
of the Army and Governor of Chelsea Hospital,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
at the head of a number of other plumed and
cocked-hatted generals in full uniform, together
with the Head-quarters Staff at the Horse
Guards. Prominent in the glittering array of
gold-laced red coats, “mounted on a cream-coloured
Arab,” was General Sir John Doyle,
Colonel of the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers; the
regiment whose prowess at Barrosa had won
the great trophy of the day—“the Eagle with
the Golden Wreath.”</p>

<p>With Royal punctuality, as the clock chimed
the half-hour, amid cheers from the crowd and
the spectators filling the windows of the Horse
Guards and Admiralty and other Government
offices overlooking the ground, came riding up
the three Princes who were to preside at the
ceremony—the Dukes of York, Cambridge, and
Gloucester.</p>

<p>The display began forthwith.</p>

<p>Preceded by the two Guards’ bands playing
the “Grenadiers’ March,” the trophy-escort of
grenadiers crossed the Parade at a slow step,
and marched in four divisions, or “platoons,”
to the old Tilt Yard orderly-room under the
Horse Guards. There the trophies had been
taken beforehand to be in readiness for the ceremony.
The grenadiers halted before the doors,
and the trophies, twelve in number, were brought
out by Lifeguardsmen from the Tilt Yard Guard
and committed to the charge of twelve picked
sergeants—six of the First Guards, six of the Coldstreamers—selected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
to bear them to the Chapel
Royal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CAPTURED EAGLES TAKE POST</div>

<p>The trophy-bearers carrying the Eagles then
took post according to the date of the capture
of each trophy; the earliest taken of the Eagles
leading. In advance of all, immediately after
the band, marched the three officers with swords
drawn; the captain and the two subalterns.
Then, with their flanking grenadiers as escort,
a file to each trophy, came, one after the other,
three Battalion Eagles of Napoleon’s 82nd of
the Line, surrendered at the capitulation of Martinique
in 1809. Immediately in rear marched
No. 1 platoon of grenadiers; in the interval
between the first trophy-group and the second.
That consisted of the Regimental Eagle of the
French 26th of the Line, surrendered at Martinique
at the same time as the Eagles of the
82nd, and then that of the 66th of the Line, surrendered
at the capitulation of Guadaloupe in
1810, with, just behind them, the all-important
trophy of the day, the first Napoleonic Eagle
captured—or, at any rate, taken possession of—by
British soldiers on the battlefield: “the
Eagle with the Golden Wreath”—that Eagle of
Napoleon’s 8th Regiment of the Line, won in
hand-to-hand fight by the 87th Royal Irish
Fusiliers at Barrosa.</p>

<p>Five of the Eagles had their silken tricolor
flags still attached to the poles. The Barrosa
Eagle had none: it showed simply a bare pole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
topped by the wreathed Eagle. The wreath,
according to a newspaper reporter present, was
“an honour conferred on the regiment for fine
conduct at the battle of Talavera, where they
were opposed to the 87th; and, by a singular
coincidence of circumstances, these regiments
met in conflict at Barrosa and recognised each
other.” As we shall see, the statement was a
freak of journalistic imagination, without a scrap
of fact behind the story, although, strangely, the
legend holds to this day and reappears periodically
in print. Adds the reporter, as to the appearance
of the Eagle, recording this time what he actually
saw: “The Eagle is fixed on a square
pedestal, and standing erect on one foot; the
other raised as if grasping something; its wings
expanded. It is about the size of a small pigeon,
and appears to be made of bronze, or of some
composition like pinchbeck, gold-gilt.” The
“something” which the talons of the Eagle appeared
to be grasping was the “thunderbolt,”
which was missing, having been either knocked
out of its place in the scuffle on the battlefield,
or stolen later by somebody for a relic. The
wreath was really of gold. A couple of its leaves
picked up on the field after the battle and given
to Major Hugh Gough, the gallant commander
of the 87th at Barrosa, are now in possession of
one of that officer’s descendants.</p>

<p>The second grenadier platoon divided the
Eagles from the first three of the flag-trophies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
borne in file, one by one, in the same way as the
Eagles. The first in date of capture led; a
French Republican standard taken in fight at
Sir Ralph Abercombie’s victory at Alexandria,
ten years before, and kept ever since at the War
Office: “the Invincible’s standard.” “As it
is falsely called,” adds the reporter; right for
once. “So tattered is it,” he continues, “that
the mottoes are not legible; a bugle in the
centre was the only figure we could distinguish.”
Two flags taken by Wellington’s men in the
Peninsula accompanied the Alexandria flag:
“a Fort Standard,” as it is described, and the
battalion colour, or “fanion,” of the Second
Battalion of Napoleon’s 5th of the Line.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TROPHY FLAGS PARADED</div>

<p>In rear of the colour of the 5th marched the
third grenadier platoon, and the last three
trophies sent to England by Wellington. Two
were a pair of tattered German standards, the
flags of the two battalions of a Prussian regiment
in Napoleon’s service, composed of unfortunate
soldiers levied compulsorily during the French
occupation of their country, and tramped off to
Spain to meet their fate under British bullets.
Each flag bore the legend “L’Empereur des
Français au Régiment Prussien” on one side,
and “Valeur et Discipline” on the other, and
was mounted on a staff with a steel pike-head
instead of an Eagle. They were silken flags of the
ordinary Napoleonic pattern. The third flag
of the group was that of a “provisional regiment”;
also with a steel pike-head to its staff.</p>

<p>From the Tilt Yard orderly-room the trophies
and their escort-guard set off, as before, in slow
time, the bands playing “God save the King!”
The sergeants, carrying the Eagles and Flags
between the files of grenadiers, marched in the
intervals between the four divisions “in double
open-order with arms advanced.” Right round
the square they now passed, close along the lines
of the troops drawn up, “the immense multitude
rending the air with huzzas.” In front of the First
Guards, in front of the recruiting parties, in front
of the long line of Coldstreamers, along each of
the three sides of the square, paced the procession
with martial pomp to the stately music<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
of the two bands as they led the way. Then it
proceeded along the fourth side of the square
until it came face to face with the King’s Guard,
all standing with ordered arms, not at the
present.</p>

<p>There was a brief pause in front of the Colour
of the King’s Guard.</p>

<p>That was the supreme moment of the display.
Now took place the formal act of obeisance to
the victors; the formal act of abasement and
humiliation for the vanquished. Amid redoubled
cheering from all sides, the Eagles and
the other flags were, one and all, formally dipped
and prostrated. “The captured standards
saluted and were lowered to the ground in token
of submission.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROSTRATED IN THE DUST</div>

<p>The procession turned away in front of the
King’s Guard and led round in front of the three
Royal Dukes, seated on their chargers, a little
in advance of the Commander-in-Chief and
Horse Guards Staff, at the centre of the parade-ground.
Again, as they now passed before the
Royal trio, the hapless Eagles of Napoleon and
the other French flags in turn were one by one
made to pay homage, bowed grovelling to the
dust; the crowd of onlookers shouting themselves
hoarse “with,” as we are told, “truly
British huzzas.”</p>

<p>After that the trophy procession marched
across to the Horse Guards archway, and through
to Whitehall and the Chapel Royal; between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Life Guards on one side and more Foot Guards
on the other, drawn up to keep a lane open through
the immense crowd of people who had gathered
there, and thronged the wide roadway. “The
procession,” says our reporter, “moved off the
Parade amid the acclamations of many thousand
spectators and entered the Chapel as the clock
was striking eleven, which [<i lang="la">sic</i>] was crowded
by all the beauty and fashion in Town.” Another
reporter speaks of the Chapel Royal as being
“exceedingly crowded in all parts with nobility
and gentlemen and ladies of distinction.”</p>

<p>“The religious part of the ceremony,” we are
told, “was solemn and impressive.” It comprised
Morning Prayer and a sermon by the
Sub-Dean. “Previous to the commencement
of the Te Deum, a pause was made, when three
grenadier sergeants entered at each door by the
sides of the Altar with the Eagles on black poles
about 8 feet high. They took their stations in
front of the Altar. Each party was guarded by
a file of grenadiers, commanded by two officers;
the whole of them with laurel-leaves in their caps
as emblems of Victory. At the same instant
the five French flags and Bonaparte’s honourable
standard entered the upper gallery at the back
of the Altar, all carried by grenadier sergeants.</p>

<p>“The whole remained presented for some time
for the gratification of the beholders, after which
the Eagles were placed in brass sockets on each
side of the Altar, suspended by brass chains.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
The five flags were suspended from the front of
the second gallery, and Bonaparte’s honourable
standard placed over the door of the second
gallery, behind the others.”</p>

<p>The trophies, with others won at Salamanca
and Waterloo, and subsequently laid up in the
Chapel Royal, were removed later to Chelsea
Royal Hospital, where all, except “the Eagle with
the Golden Wreath,” are now kept treasured amid
befitting surroundings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STOLEN FROM CHELSEA AT MIDDAY</div>

<p>“The Eagle with the Golden Wreath” disappeared
from Chelsea Hospital in broad daylight.
It was displayed in the Chapel, affixed in front
of the organ-loft over the doorway, until it suddenly
vanished from there a little after midday
on Friday, April 16, 1852, in the absence of the
pensioner-custodian of the Chapel during the
Hospital dinner-hour. How it was stolen was
apparent; but the thief was never traced. The
thief, attracted undoubtedly by the widely told
story that the wreath was of gold, made his way
into the Chapel by the roof, which was undergoing
repairs at the time, to which he got access
by a workman’s ladder. He got inside by the
trap-door on the leads above the organ-loft.
There, with a saw, he cut through the Eagle-pole
near where it was fastened to the organ-loft,
and, secreting it under his coat, made his escape
by the way he had come, unseen by anybody.
The Eagle-pole was found outside, in front of
the building, with the Eagle and wreath wrenched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
off. For some reason the Royal Hospital authorities
of the day offered a reward of only a
sovereign, and though the London police did
their best, the malefactor was never discovered.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>At Barrosa Napoleon’s 8th of the Line was
in the French column that made its attack on
the right. It was one of the regiments that
charged forward across the plain at the foot
of Barrosa ridge, to break through General
Graham’s second brigade and drive it back to
the edge of the cliffs by the seashore, while the
French left attack seized the ridge itself, and
beat back the British first brigade in the act of
hastening to regain that unwisely abandoned
position. The Eagle went down in the fierce
counter-attack with which Graham’s men on the
plain, the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers in the front
line, met the French onset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP THEM”</div>

<p>What befell the 8th of the Line is told by one
of their own officers in his <i lang="fr">Journal de Guerre</i>—Lieutenant-Colonel
Vigo-Roussillon, in command
of the First Battalion, with which was the Eagle.</p>

<p>Just before the critical moment, says Colonel
Roussillon, the 8th, who were on the flank of
the French second line, lost touch with the
regiment next them, and had in consequence to
meet the 87th by themselves. They fired their
hardest as the British troops came on, “but
could not stop them, ever advancing to a bayonet
attack.”</p>

<p>They came on silently, steadily, irresistibly.
“Their officers,” adds one of Victor’s staff,
“kept up all the time the old custom of striking
with their canes those of the men who fell out of
the ranks. Our own non-commissioned officers,”
he adds, “placed as a supernumerary rank,
crossed their muskets behind the squads, thus
forming buttresses which kept the ranks from
giving way. Several of the French officers, also,
picked up the muskets of the wounded, and flung
themselves into the gaps made in the ranks of
the men.”</p>

<p>“I saw the English line,” describes Colonel
Roussillon again, “at sixty paces continuing to
advance at a slow step without firing. It
seemed impossible to stop them; we had not
sufficient men.”</p>

<p>Apparently he then caught sight of General
Graham, leading the British line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<p>“Under the influence of a sort of despair, I
urged forward my charger, a strong Polish horse,
against an English mounted officer who seemed
to be the colonel of the nearest regiment coming
on at us. I got up to him, and was about to run
him through with my sword, when I was held
back by a sense of compassion and abandoned
the murderous thought. He was an officer with
white hair and a fine figure, and had his hat
in his hand, and was cheering on his men. His
calmness and noble air of dignity irresistibly
arrested my arm.”</p>

<p>Such is the lieutenant-colonel’s own account.
But did he really get quite close to the general?
Graham was the last man in the world to let him
get back unfought!</p>

<p>“I then,” as Vigo-Roussillon continues,
“quickly galloped back to my own men, and
was riding along the line, telling them to meet
the enemy with our bayonets, and drive them
back, when a bullet from an English marksman
broke my right leg.</p>

<p>“I managed to dismount and tried to pass
through in rear of the line, but it was impossible
to walk. The ground was covered with thick
bushes, and I was crippled and in great pain.
All I could do was to sit down where I was,
calling on the men to fire again. A moment
later I was enveloped in smoke; and at the same
instant the English charged in among us.</p>

<p>“I called out my loudest, cheering on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
men; and now two soldiers tried to lift me up
and carry me. But both were shot down.</p>

<p>“For the time we held our own, and kept the
enemy back; but some of the English got round
us. Seeing themselves outflanked, the battalion
began to give ground. Then came a second
furious charge from the English, and that broke
us.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“FIGHTING WITH THEIR FISTS”</div>

<p>The fight, man to man, went on desperately
for several minutes—some of the British soldiers,
as yet another French officers relates, fighting
with their fists. “Many of the Englishmen
broke their weapons in striking with the butts
or bayonets; but they never seemed to think
of using the swords they wore at their sides. They
went on fighting with their fists.”</p>

<p>It was in the final <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> that “the Eagle with
the Golden Wreath” was taken; after a sharp and
fierce hand-to-hand fight round it.</p>

<p>Colonel Roussillon himself was at almost the
same moment struck down, and lay insensible
for a space among the dead near by. He was
recovering his senses and trying to stand up, when,
as he tells, a British sergeant saw him and ran at
him with his halberd. He parried the thrust,
and kept the sergeant off, and then a British officer
came up. To him the Commandant of the First
Battalion of the 8th surrendered his sword.</p>

<p>The fight for the Eagle—on one hand to take it,
on the other to keep it—was furious; desperately
and heroically contested by both sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>First, a gallant Irish boy, from Kilkenny,
Ensign Edward Keogh of the 87th, caught sight
of it, borne on high above the fray. There
had been no unscrewing of the Eagle of the
8th, no trying to break it from its pole. “See
that Eagle, sergeant!” called Keogh to Sergeant
Masterton, among the foremost, close
by his officer; and then he dashed straight
into the thick of the party round the Eagle,
sword in hand. The brave lad cut his way
through, with Masterton and four or five privates
close behind him. He got close up to the “Porte-Aigle,”
crossed swords with him, and got a grip
of the Eagle-pole. But he could not wrench it
from the no less brave Frenchman’s hands before
he went down with half a dozen musket bullets
and bayonet stabs in his body.</p>

<p>Porte-Aigle Guillemin, as the gallant French
Eagle-bearer of the 8th was named, fell dead at
the same moment, shot through the head by
one of the British privates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW THE TUSSLE ENDED</div>

<p>Instantly other Frenchmen rushed up to save
the Eagle, and formed round it hastily. One
of the British privates who seized hold of the staff
was slashed to death, and the French recovered
it. The fight round the Eagle went on for some
minutes. In that time no fewer than seven
French officers and sub-officers fell dead in defence
of the Eagle. An eighth officer, Lieutenant
Gazan, clung to the pole to the last,
regardless of wounds that nearly hacked him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
pieces. Finally the Eagle was torn from his
grasp by Sergeant Masterton, at the end the sole
unwounded survivor of the attacking British
party. Gazan “survived miraculously,” and
lived to be decorated by Napoleon for his devoted
courage. Masterton seized the Eagle and
kept it. So “the Eagle with the Golden
Wreath” became a British trophy.</p>

<p>From the crossing of the bayonets in the final
charge to the taking of the Eagle, the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> lasted
about fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The remnant of the 8th were saved by a rally
to the spot by the French 54th, after another
regiment, the 47th, had attempted its rescue in
vain. The 47th lost their Eagle in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>,
but recovered it. “The man who had charge
of it was obliged to throw it away, from excessive
fatigue and a wound,” explains a British
officer. The 8th lost at Barrosa their Colonel
(Autié) and the Lieutenant-Colonel of the Second
Battalion, killed; Vigo-Roussillon, of the First
Battalion, wounded; and 17 other officers and
934 of the rank and file killed or wounded.
The <i lang="fr">Moniteur</i>, the official Paris newspaper under
the Napoleonic <i lang="fr">régime</i>, in reporting the battle
of April 5, referred to the loss of the Eagle in
these terms: “A battalion of the 8th, having
been charged in wood-covered ground, and the
Eagle-bearer being killed, his Eagle has not been
found since.”</p>

<p>The battalion that fared so hardly had to pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the regulation penalty. Napoleon gave the 8th
no other Eagle. He held rigidly to his rule,
and set his face relentlessly against a second
presentation. They must present him first with
a standard taken on the battlefield from the
enemy. But with Wellington’s men opposed
to them to the end, the 8th got few chances in
that direction. They had to fight without an
Eagle to the close of the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Two days after Barrosa, when General Graham
re-entered Cadiz with the Spanish army, “the
Eagle with the Golden Wreath” was publicly
paraded through the crowded streets, “between
the regimental colours,” as the 87th marched to
barracks, the church bells ringing triumphantly,
and amid exultant shouts and cheers of the
populace, and cries of “Long live Spain! Death
to our oppressors!” At the barracks “we
presented the Eagle to our gallant commander,”
says one of the officers.</p>

<p>The Eagle was then sent to England in the
custody of the officer carrying General Graham’s
despatch. Its capture is commemorated to
this day by the Royal Irish Fusiliers, who
wear “an Eagle with a Wreath of Laurel”
as a regimental badge, while a similar Eagle
is embroidered in gold on the regimental colour.
Also, a representation of the wreathed Barrosa
Eagle was granted later on as a special augmentation
to the family arms of the officer who
commanded the 87th in the battle, Major Hugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Gough, on his being raised to the Peerage while
Commander-in-Chief in India after the first
Sikh War. “The Aiglers” was always the
regiment’s sobriquet after Barrosa among their
comrades in Wellington’s army; a sobriquet
that has endured since then in the form of “the
Aigle-Takers,” although our modern recruits
are said to prefer calling themselves “the Bird-Catchers.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ONE OF THE PARIS WREATHS</div>

<p>It was in this way that the Barrosa trophy
Eagle came by its golden wreath. The decoration,
as has been said, had nothing to do with
Talavera.</p>

<p>The wreath was one of those voted by the
City of Paris to the regiments that had gone
through the Jena and Polish frontier campaigns,
the first of which was presented to the Imperial
Guard. First of all, in the outburst of patriotic
enthusiasm in France at the news of Jena, wreaths
had been voted as decorations for the Eagles,
by way of popular tribute to the regiments
which had helped in dealing that staggering blow
to the famous Prussian Army. After the crowning
victory of Friedland which ended the war,
in a fresh outburst of enthusiasm, golden wreaths
were voted wholesale for the Eagles of all the
corps that had taken part in the fighting that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
followed Jena, during the nine months of war,
down to the final day of Friedland. It was
a costly guerdon, and their proposed generosity
staggered the Paris municipality when the estimate
was presented. No fewer than 378 wreaths—according
to the official return—had to be provided.
But the vote had been carried by acclamation
on its first proposal, and trumpeted
all over France. Also, the Emperor had taken
up with the idea warmly. The Paris authorities
dared not back out, and had to go on with it in
spite of the cost. They carried it out with so
good a grace that, as the sequel, a suggestion
came from the Tuileries that the Austerlitz
battalions of the Grand Army which had not
had the fortune to be in the Jena-Friedland
campaign should receive wreaths as well, an
Imperial hint that the authorities, shrinking
from the extra expense, were so slow to fall in
with, that in the end it had to be forced on them,
by means of a bluntly worded letter through the
Ministry of War. “Tell the Prefect of the
Seine,” wrote Napoleon to the War Minister,
“that I expect wreaths of gold, similar to those
given for Jena and Friedland, to be provided on
behalf of the City of Paris for all the regiments
at Austerlitz!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACROSS GERMANY IN CARTS</div>

<p>The 8th was presented with its wreath in
Paris, while on the way to take part in the Peninsular
War. It was one of the regiments of the
First Corps of the Grand Army, which Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
hastily recalled from Germany in the spring of
1808, and hurried across Europe to reinforce the
troops in Spain on the first news of serious
trouble being on foot in that quarter. The whole
First Army Corps was recalled; starting from
Berlin, where it had been quartered, and journeying
by Magdeburg and Coblentz. Along the
route the unfortunate German burgomasters
and village authorities had to provide, not only
provisions day by day, but transport vehicles
for 30,000 soldiers; mostly farm-carts and wagons,
each taking from four to sixteen men. The
troops travelled by night and day, with only
two stoppages of fifty minutes each in the
twenty-four hours, for meals, and the authorities
of the villages and towns named as halting-places
were compelled to have hot food kept ready so
that the men might fall to instantly on arrival.
It was a journey the soldiers never forgot.
The weather was rough and wet, the roads
in places were almost impassable, and the carts
continually broke down, in addition to which
the peasant-drivers requisitioned for the conveyances
deserted at every opportunity, usually
going off at night with the horses after cutting
the traces, leaving their wagon-loads of sleeping
soldiers stranded by the roadside.</p>

<p>The 8th received its wreath at the Barrier of
Pantin, on the outskirts of Paris. It arrived
with the Second Division of the corps, and the
troops were met by the Prefect of the Seine and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the Municipal Council in State, while Marshal
Victor, the commander of the Army Corps, attended
the ceremony in full-dress uniform. He
replied to the Prefect’s complimentary address
by declaring that “these golden crowns henceforward
decorating the Eagles of the First Corps
will to them ever be additional incentives to
victory.” One by one the regiments passed
before the Prefect, who hung round each Eagle’s
neck “a wreath of gold, shaped as two branches
of laurel.” A triumphal march into Paris and
an open-air banquet to all ranks in the Tivoli
Gardens, with free tickets to the theatres after
it, wound up the day.</p>

<p>All along the line of march through France
to the Spanish frontier, banquets and elaborate
festivities welcomed the regiments—and at the
same time, it would appear, gave some of their
entertainers more than they bargained for. The
triumphal progress, from all accounts, proved
such hard work for the ladies in the country
towns, where public balls were in the programme
every night, that at some places for the later
comers—the 8th and other regiments in the
Second Division of Marshal Victor’s corps—the
balls had to be abandoned, “because the ladies
were too tired to dance any more.” It was explained,
with apologies, that they had practically
been danced off their feet by the regiments
of the First Division, which had preceded the
Second, incessantly passing through during the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
previous three weeks, and that “most of the
ladies, through sheer fatigue, had taken to their
beds!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEY DID NOT MEET AT TALAVERA</div>

<p>At Talavera, the 8th, as part of a brigade of
three regiments, had a passage of arms on the
battlefield, first with the British 83rd; and then
with the Guards; lastly with the 48th, before
whose magnificent charge in the final phase of
the fight they had to give ground. They did
not meet the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers at all
in the battle.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<span class="subhead">OTHER EAGLES IN ENGLAND FROM BATTLEFIELDS OF SPAIN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Napoleon’s</span> Eagles made a second appearance
before the London populace in the following
year. That was on September 30, 1812, and
the Horse Guards Parade was again the scene
of the display—this time with more elaborate
ceremonial, and with the added presence of yet
greater personages. Queen Charlotte herself
this time witnessed the reception ceremony, with
four of the Princesses; and the Prince Regent
in person, “mounted on a white charger,”
attended, to be publicly done obeisance to by
the humbled standards of the enemy. Four of
his Royal brothers, the Dukes of Clarence, York,
Cambridge, and Sussex, accompanied the Prince
Regent. Only the poor old King, blind and
insane, was absent of the Royal family, remaining
in his seclusion at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>The Queen and Princesses watched the scene
from the windows of the Levée Room at the
Horse Guards, looking down over the Parade;
the Prince Regent was on the ground and took
the salute. The Eagles this time were five in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
number; and four French flags, one of exceptional
interest, the garrison-standard of Badajoz,
were with them in the procession.</p>

<p>The military display was on the grandest
scale possible; the <i lang="fr">ensemble</i> making up, as we
are told, “a spectacle grand and impressive
beyond anything ever beheld.” The First and
Second Life Guards were present, “drawn up
in a line reaching from the Foreign Office nearly
to Carlton House,” with their bands in State
dress and their standards. All three regiments
of Foot Guards took part, with the State Colour
of the First Guards, and three bands. Horse
and Foot Artillery from Woolwich were also
there; forming by themselves one side of the
great hollow square which occupied the wide
space of the ground, the scene of the reception
of “the Eagle with the Golden Wreath.” Ninety
grenadiers, drawn from the three regiments of
Foot Guards, thirty from each, formed the
trophy-escort, which, as before, accompanied
the Eagles and captured standards round the
square at a slow march—the five Eagles in advance
by themselves, borne by as many Guards’
sergeants between files of grenadiers with fixed
bayonets.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES ARE HUMBLED AGAIN</div>

<p>Again the trophies of Napoleon were spared
nothing in the humiliation that they had to
undergo. Twice were they lowered to the dust
before the Queen; twice to the Prince Regent;
eight times before the standards of the Life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Guards; three times before the standards of
the Guards and the King’s Colour of the First
Guards, “the immense concourse of spectators
rending the air with their huzzas” every time
the trophies went down. Then, as before, the
trophies were paraded across Whitehall to the
Chapel Royal, and solemnly “churched” and
hung up there, before the Royal family and
“all the Cabinet Ministers and the leading
members of the nobility in London.”</p>

<p>They were this time all Wellington’s trophies.
Two of the Eagles were spoils from the battle
of Salamanca—“dreadfully mutilated and disfigured
in the conflict,” according to a newspaper
reporter’s account, “one of them having lost
its head, part of the neck, one leg, half the
thunderbolt, and the distinctive number; the
other without one leg and the thunderbolt.”
Two had been taken in Madrid “in more perfect
state and without their flags.” The last of the
five had been “found on the way to Ciudad
Rodrigo, in the bed of a river, dried up in summer,
having been thrown away some months before
during Masséna’s retreat.” The four Eagles
which still bore distinctive numbers were, we are
told, “those of the 22nd, 13th, and 51st and
the 39th.” Of the standards, the garrison flag
of Badajoz looked “like a sieve, a great part of
it quite red with human blood”; the four other
colours “were so mutilated that not a letter or
device was legible.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>How we came by the trophies so displayed in
London on that Wednesday forenoon is our
story.</p>

<p>The two Salamanca Eagles were—and are,
for they have a place to-day among our Chelsea
Hospital trophies—mementoes of one of the most
dramatic episodes of a battle in which there were
many.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WELLINGTON AND SALAMANCA</div>

<p>Salamanca, it may be said incidentally—the
battle, like Waterloo, was fought on a Sunday,
on July 22, 1812—was, in Wellington’s own
eyes, his <i lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</i>, his masterpiece, although
it may be rather overlooked now perhaps by
most of us and the world at large, eclipsed in
the dazzling splendour of the last crowning
victory of Waterloo. It was at Salamanca that
Wellington, in the words of a French officer,
speaking, of course, in general terms, “defeated
40,000 men in forty minutes.” The victory was
held in such estimation by Wellington himself
that he selected it in preference to all his other
victories to be displayed over again in a sham
fight on the Plain of Saint-Denis in the presence
of the three Allied Sovereigns during the occupation
of Paris in 1815 after Waterloo. Of it
he wrote at the time: “I never saw an army
receive such a beating.”</p>

<p>Upwards of 6,000 prisoners were taken, including
one general and 136 other officers. Six
thousand of the enemy, at the lowest computation,
were left dead or wounded on the field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of battle. Three French generals were killed
and three wounded. Marshal Marmont himself,
the enemy’s commander-in-chief, was among
the wounded; grievously maimed by a bursting
shell as he galloped to rally one of his broken
columns. “Spurring furiously to the point of
danger, he was struck by the fragment of a
shell, which shattered his left arm and tore open
his side.” Marmont bore the arm in a sling for
the rest of his life. He was carried off the
field under fire, on a stretcher made of a soldier’s
great-coat with a couple of muskets thrust
through the armholes to give it shape, under
the escort of a squad of grenadiers. Eleven
cannon—melted down at Woolwich Arsenal in
1820 as a cheap way of making new field-guns
for the British Army—with the two Eagles and
six stand of colours, were the trophies of the
day.</p>

<p>The two Salamanca trophy Eagles at Chelsea
Hospital are the spoils of the fiercest cavalry
charge that British horsemen ever delivered
on a battlefield; the death-ride—for 1,200 of
Napoleon’s infantry—of the Heavy Brigade,
which annihilated an entire French division in
less than a quarter of an hour. It came about
as one of the results of that opening false move
on the part of the French commander which
cost France in the end the loss of the battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARMONT’S FATAL BLUNDER</div>

<p>Marmont, after a series of ably conducted
manœuvres in the neighbourhood of Salamanca,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
had forced Wellington, on July 22, into a
position so unfavourable that the British
commander decided to retire towards the Portuguese
frontier under cover of darkness during
the following night. But at the last moment
the French marshal overreached himself. Taking
in the difficulties that confronted his opponent
he attempted to anticipate him and cut him off
from his base by barring the one line of retreat
that was open to Wellington. In doing that,
Marmont gave his game away. He rashly
divided his force in the presence of the enemy,
separating his left wing to a distance from the
main body and marching off a whole division of
infantry, cavalry, and artillery to occupy the
road to Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p>The fault was flagrant, and Wellington seized
eagerly at the chance all unexpectedly offered
him. He was at breakfast when Marmont’s
troops began their false move and the aide
de camp whom he had posted on the look-out
hurriedly came to him with the news. “I
think they are extending to the left——” the
young officer began. He did not finish the
sentence.</p>

<p>“The devil they are!” interposed Wellington
hastily, with his mouth full. “Give me
the glass!”</p>

<p>He took it, and for nearly a minute scanned
the movements of the enemy with fixed attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>“By God!” he ejaculated abruptly as he
lowered the glass. “That’ll do!”</p>

<p>He turned to another aide de camp.</p>

<p>“Ride off and tell Clinton and Leith to return
to their former ground.” These were the
generals commanding the Fifth and Sixth
Divisions, on the right and right-centre of the
British position. Then Wellington ordered up
his horse. Closing his spy-glass with a snap,
he turned with these words to his Spanish
attaché, Colonel Alava: “Mon cher Alava,
Marmont est perdu!” A moment later Wellington
was on horseback and his staff also, all
galloping off.</p>

<p>Wellington grasped the meaning of Marmont’s
move. He saw his chance of falling on
in force and overpowering the detached French
wing before help could reach it.</p>

<p>He made his way as fast as his charger could
carry him to the British Third Division—Picton’s
men, temporarily commanded by
Wellington’s brother-in-law, General Sir Edward
Pakenham.</p>

<p>“As he rode up to Pakenham,” says an officer
whose regiment was close by, “every eye was
turned on him. He looked paler than usual,
but was quite unruffled in his manner, and as
calm as if the battle to be fought was nothing
more than an ordinary assemblage of troops for
a field-day.”</p>

<p>“Ned,” said Wellington, as he drew rein<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
beside Pakenham, tapping him on the shoulder
and pointing in the direction of the separated
French column as its leading troops were beginning
to move towards their distant position,
“Ned, d’ye see those fellows on the hill? Throw
your division in column, and at ’em and drive
’em to the Devil!”</p>

<p>“I will, my lord, by God!” was Pakenham’s
laconic reply, and he turned away to give the
necessary orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FURIOUS COUNTER-ATTACK</div>

<p>The two Eagles were taken in the course of
Pakenham’s attack, when the Third Division,
with the Fifth advancing on one flank, was
moving forward to meet the fierce counter-attack
with which the enemy, after the first
collision, attempted to make amends for their
commander’s blunder.</p>

<p>“We were assailed,” describes a British officer
in the Third Division, “by a multitude who,
reinforced, again rallied and turned upon us
with fury. The peals of musketry along the
centre continued without intermission, the smoke
was so thick that nothing to our left was distinguishable;
some men of the Fifth Division
got intermingled with ours; the dry grass was
set on fire by the numerous cartridge-papers
that strewed the battlefield; the air was scorching;
and the smoke rolling onwards in huge
volumes, nearly suffocated us.”</p>

<p>In the midst of the din and turmoil the Heavy
Cavalry came suddenly on the scene. “A loud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
cheering was heard in our rear; the Brigade
half turned round, supposing themselves about
to be attacked by the French cavalry. A few
seconds passed, the trampling of horses was
heard, the smoke cleared away, and the Heavy
Brigade of Le Marchant was seen coming forward
in line at a canter. ‘Open right and left!’
was an order quickly obeyed; the line opened,
and the cavalry passed through the intervals,
and, forming rapidly in our front, prepared for
their work.”</p>

<p>Catastrophe for the French assailants followed
at once; swift, overwhelming, irremediable.
The enemy in front had practically ceased to
exist within the next twelve minutes. The
entire French division and its supporting troops
were struck down and shattered; broken to
fragments and annihilated.</p>

<p>There was a “whirling cloud of dust, moving
swiftly forward and carrying within its womb
the trampling sound of a charging multitude.
As it passed the left of the Third Division, Le
Marchant’s heavy horsemen, flanked by Anson’s
Light Cavalry, broke out at full speed, and
the next instant 1,200 French infantry, formed
in several lines, were trampled down with
terrible clangour and tumult. Bewildered and
blinded they cast away their arms and ran
through the openings of the British squadron,
stooping and demanding quarter, while the
dragoons, big men on big horses, rode on hard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
smiting with their long, glittering swords in
uncontrollable power, and the Third Division,
following at speed, shouted as the French
masses fell in succession before this dreadful
charge.”</p>

<p>So Napier describes the onset.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARGING DOWN AT FULL GALLOP</div>

<p>Startled and aghast at what they saw coming
at them, the French attempted hastily to form
squares. But Le Marchant’s impetuous squadrons
were too quick for them. They came
swooping down, the troopers galloping their
hardest, with loosened reins, all racing forward,
charging down with the irresistible sweep of
an avalanche, and crashed into the midst of
the ill-fated infantrymen before the squares
could be formed.</p>

<p>Down on the enemy the cavalry thundered,
1,200 flashing British sabres. Three of the finest
regiments of the British Army formed the
brigade—the 3rd Dragoons, the “King’s Own”;
the 4th, “Queen’s Own”; the 5th Dragoon
Guards—strong and burly men on big-boned
horses, and with sharp-edged swords. “<i lang="la">Nec
aspera terrent</i>” was—and is—the fearless motto
of the gallant “King’s Own,” who showed the
way; and they flinched at nothing that day.
“<i lang="la">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</i>” was—and is—the
motto of the 5th, who closed the column; and
dead and wounded and prisoners were the vestiges
they left in rear on that stricken field.</p>

<p>General Edward Le Marchant, a daring and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
capable soldier—“a most noble officer,” was
what Wellington called him—led them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOUR REGIMENTS CUT TO PIECES</div>

<p>A French regiment a little in advance, the
ill-fated 62nd of the Line, was the first to face
the British, and to go down. They did not
attempt to form square. They had, indeed, no
time to do so. Yet they were in a formation
sufficiently formidable. The 62nd was a regiment
of three battalions, and stood formed up
in a column of half-battalions, presenting six
successive lines closely massed one behind the
other. Their front ranks opened fire just before
the leading horsemen reached them, but it did
not check the British onset even for a moment.
The cavalry bore vigorously forward at a gallop
and burst into and through their column, riding
it down on the spot. Nearly the whole regiment
was killed, wounded, or taken; leaving the
broken remnants to be carried off as prisoners
by the infantry of the Third Division as these
raced up in rear, clearing the ground before
them.</p>

<p>The 62nd were disposed of by the cavalry in
less than two minutes. According to French
official returns, the unlucky regiment, out of a
total strength that morning of 2,800 of all ranks
in its three battalions, lost 20 officers and
1,100 men in killed alone; the survivors who
escaped capture not being sufficient to form half
a battalion.</p>

<p>Cheering triumphantly, the charging squadrons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
dashed on. They came full tilt on a
second French regiment, the 22nd, catching it
in the act of forming square. The front face
of the square was already drawn up and met
the troopers with a hasty volley which brought
down some of the men and horses. But that
made little difference. The next moment the
cavalry were on them. The mass of the square
in rear made but a weak effort at resistance.
They swayed back, broke their ranks, and fell
apart in utter confusion. Slashed down right
and left, as had been the case with the 62nd,
in little more than a minute only groups of
fugitives were left, to be made prisoners by the
British infantry, following in rear of the
horsemen.</p>

<p>The cavalry raced on then to attack a third
French regiment. In turn it attempted to make
a stand, but only to be dealt with in like manner.
It, too, was caught before its square could be
formed, and was ridden down.</p>

<p>Yet another French battalion confronted the
British troopers after that. It had had time to
take advantage of a small copse, an open wood
of evergreen oaks, where it formed its ranks
in <i lang="fr">colonne serrée</i>, to await attack, and make a
stand. “The men reserved their fire with much
coolness, until the cavalry came within twenty
yards. Then they poured it in on the concentrated
mass of men and horses with deadly
effect. Nearly a third of the dragoons came to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the ground, but the remainder had sufficient
command of their horses to dash forward. They
succeeded in breaking the French ranks and dispersing
them in utter confusion over the field.”</p>

<p>All the time the infantry in rear were racing
on with exultant cheers, finishing off the horsemen’s
work as fast as they came up. It was an
easy task. Further fight had been scared out
of the French under the stress of the fearful
experience they had gone through. “Such as
got away from the sabres of the horsemen,” says
one of the British officers, “sought safety
amongst the ranks of our infantry; and, scrambling
under their horses, ran to us for protection,
like men who, having escaped the first shock of
a wreck, will cling to any broken spar, no matter
how little to be depended on. Hundreds of beings,
frightfully disfigured, in whom the human face
and form were almost obliterated—black with
dust, worn down with fatigue, and covered with
sabre-cuts and blood—threw themselves among
us for safety. Not a man was bayoneted—not
one even molested or plundered. The invincible
old Third on this day surpassed themselves; for
they not only defeated their terrible enemies in
a fair stand-up fight, but saved them when total
annihilation seemed the only thing.”</p>

<p>The two Salamanca Eagles were taken now.
They fell to two infantry officers as their actual
captors: one to an officer of a regiment of the
Third Division, and the other to an officer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Fifth Division, which had come into the fight,
and were following the cavalry, partly mingled
with Pakenham’s men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAKEN IN HAND-TO-HAND FIGHT</div>

<p>The first Eagle—that of the hapless French
62nd, whose fate has been told—fell to Lieutenant
Pierce of the 44th, a regiment in the
Fifth Division. He came on the Eagle-bearer
while in the act of unscrewing the Eagle from its
pole in order to hide it under his long overcoat
and get away with it. Pierce sprang on the
Frenchman, and tussled with him for the Eagle.
The second Porte-Aigle joined in the fight, whereupon
three men of the 44th ran to their officer’s
assistance. A third Frenchman, a private, added
himself to the combatants, and was in the act
of bayoneting the British lieutenant, when one
of the men of the 44th, Private Finlay, shot him
through the head and saved the officer’s life.
Both the Porte-Aigles were killed a moment later—one
by Lieutenant Pierce, who snatched the
Eagle from its dead bearer’s hands. In his
excitement over the prize Pierce rewarded the
privates who had helped him by emptying his
pockets on the spot, and dividing what money
he had on him amongst them—twenty dollars.
A sergeant’s halberd was then procured, on
which the Eagle was stuck and carried triumphantly
through the remainder of the battle.
Lieutenant Pierce presented it next morning to
General Leith, the Commander of the Fifth
Division, who directed him to carry it to Wellington.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
In honour of the exploit the 44th, now
the Essex Regiment, bear the badge of a Napoleonic
Eagle on the regimental colour, and the
officers wear a similar badge on their mess-jackets.</p>

<p>The second Eagle taken was that of the 22nd
of the Line. It was captured by a British
officer of the 30th, Ensign Pratt, attached for
duty to Major Cruikshank’s 7th Portuguese, a
Light Infantry (or Caçadores) battalion, serving
with the Third Division. He took it to General
Pakenham, whose mounted orderly displayed
the Eagle of the 22nd publicly after the battle,
“carrying it about wherever the general went for
the next two days.”</p>

<p>Two more Eagles, it was widely reported in
the Army, came into the possession of other
regiments of the Third and Fifth Divisions. One
of them is said to have “wanted its head and
number”; but what became of them is unknown.
Possibly the existence of these particular
trophies was merely camp gossip. According
to one story, an officer picked up one of
the Eagles during the battle and “carried it
about in his cap for some days.” No Eagles,
however, reached head-quarters after Salamanca
except those of the 62nd and 22nd, which in due
course were sent to England.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ONE THAT JUST ESCAPED</div>

<p>One Eagle narrowly evaded capture at the
hands of the Hanoverian Dragoons of the King’s
German Legion in the pursuit after Salamanca.
It escaped—to find its way to Chelsea Hospital
on a later day, as the famous trophy of our own
1st Dragoons, the “Royals,” at Waterloo. What
took place when the Eagle of the 105th of the
Line so nearly fell into the enemy’s hands after
Salamanca is a story that in its incidents stands
by itself.</p>

<p>General Anson’s cavalry brigade, made up of
British Light Dragoons and the Hanoverians,
was sent in chase to follow and break up the wreck
of the defeated army. It came upon the French
rearguard in the act of taking post at a place
called Garcia Hernandez. In front were several
squadrons of cavalry; in rear the 105th of the
Line. The three battalions of the regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
were moving in column, with guns in the intervals.
Not seeing the French infantry and guns
at first, owing to an intervening ridge, Anson
rode for the cavalry and drove them in. “Their
squadrons fled from Anson’s troopers, abandoning
three battalions of infantry, who in separate
columns were making up a hollow slope, hoping
to gain the crest of some heights before the pursuing
cavalry could fall on, and the two foremost
did reach higher ground, and there formed in
squares.” The squares at once opened fire on
the horsemen, and for a moment checked them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A SQUARE CHARGED AND BROKEN</div>

<p>The Hanoverian Dragoons were the nearest
of the pursuers to the rearmost of the French
squares, and there was no way to ride past without
exposing their flank at close range. Captain
Von Decken, who was leading the dragoons,
on the spur of the moment took the daring
decision to attack the square with the single
squadron he had with him, then and there. Without
an instant’s hesitation the gallant captain
charged, regardless of the fierce fusillade that
met him at once, from which his men went down
all round. They dropped fast under fire. By
twos, by threes, by tens, all round they fell;
yet the rest of them, surmounting the difficulties
of the ground, hurled themselves in a mass on
the column and went clean through it.</p>

<p>The gallant Von Decken was among the first
to go down, shot dead a hundred yards from
the square. But a leader no less heroic was at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
hand. Instantly Captain Von Uslar Gleichen,
in charge of the left troop, dashed to the front.
He rode out to the head of the squadron, inciting
his men by voice and gesture and example.
Another French volley smote hard on the
squadron, but the intrepid troopers galloped
through it, and, bringing up their right flank,
swept on towards the enemy’s bayonets, making
to attack the square on two sides. The two
foremost ranks of the French were on the knee
with bayonets to the front, presenting a deadly
double row of steel. In rear the steady muskets
of four standing ranks were levelled at the horsemen.
The dragoons pressed on close up, and some
were trying, in vain, to beat aside the bayonets
before them, and make a gap through, when an
accident at the critical moment gave the opportunity.
A shot from the kneeling ranks, apparently
fired unintentionally, as it is said, killed a
horse, and caused it with its rider to fall forward,
right across and on top of the bayonets. Thus a
lane was unexpectedly laid open to the cavalry.
They seized the chance instantly and crowded
in through. The square was broken. It was
cleft apart: its ranks were scattered and dispersed.
All was over in a few moments. Within
three minutes the entire battalion had been either
cut down under the slaughtering swords of the
dragoons or had been made prisoners.</p>

<p>Immediately on that another Hanoverian
captain, Von Reitzenstein, came sweeping by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
with the second squadron, riding for the second
French square. These met the charge with a
bold front and rapid volley, but their <i lang="fr">moral</i>
had been shaken by the startling and horrible
scene they had just beheld. The front face of
the second square gave way as the horsemen got
close, and four-fifths of that battalion were either
sabred on the spot or made prisoners.</p>

<p>There was yet, near by, the third battalion in
its square. Its numbers had been added to by
such fugitive survivors from the first and second
squares as had been able to reach the place and
get inside. The third squadron of the Dragoons
dealt with the third square in the same way,
riding boldly at it, and breaking in with deadly
results, as before.</p>

<p>How the Eagle of the 105th was saved—it was
with the first battalion in the square first broken—is
not on record. It did, however, somehow,
evade capture—hidden hastily perhaps beneath
the coat of somebody in the handful of men
who got away in the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>. Only the broken
Eagle-pole was left, to be picked up among
the dead after the fight:</p>

<p>Described a British officer who went over
the ground after the fight:</p>

<p>“The contest ended in a dreadful massacre
of the French infantry. The 105th bravely
stood their ground, but the ponderous weight
of the heavy cavalry broke down all resistance;
and arms lopped off, heads cloven to the spine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
or gashes across the breast and shoulders showed
the fearful encounter that had taken place.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPOILS TAKEN IN ANOTHER WAY</div>

<p>The third of the trophy Eagles paraded in
London before the Prince Regent was that of
Napoleon’s 39th of the Line. It had been
picked up in the dried-up bed of the river Ceira,
one of the tributaries of the Douro. Apparently
the Eagle had been dropped, owing to the fall
of its bearer during the night action of Foz
d’Aronce on June 15, 1811, when Ney’s corps
of Masséna’s army, then retreating from Torres
Vedras, was roughly handled and driven across
the river by Wellington’s Third and Light
Divisions.</p>

<p>The fourth and fifth of the Eagles were found
at Madrid on Wellington’s occupation of the
city after Salamanca—stored away in the
French arsenal and army dépôt there, to which
uses the ancient Royal Palace of the Buen
Retiro, just outside the walls of Madrid, had
been converted.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> Seventeen hundred men held
the Retiro, and the approaches to the arsenal
had been fortified by order of Napoleon, but
the garrison surrendered without firing a shot.
They gave up to the victors 180 brass cannon,
900 barrels of powder, 20,000 stand of arms,
muskets and bayonets, together with the Eagles
of the 13th and 51st of the Line, which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
laid up at the Retiro for safe custody while the
two regiments were operating in a wild part of
the country against the Spanish guerrillas.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The last Eagles taken by Wellington in the
Peninsular War came into our hands in the
battles of the Pyrenees.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Neither of them is
now in existence. One was taken by our 28th
in the combat of the Pass of Maya. The 28th,
supporting the 92nd Highlanders in the fighting,
overwhelmed with a series of fierce volleys an
unfortunate French regiment, which was afterwards
discovered to be the French 28th—a
curious coincidence. The Eagle of the 28th,
the senior corps of its brigade, was found on the
battlefield, and was brought to England and
hung in the Chapel Royal, Whitehall. It disappeared
from there in circumstances already
related. The second French Eagle was that
of the 52nd of the Line, presented by Wellington,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
as has been told, to the Spanish Cortes.
That also has since been entirely lost sight of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S ORDER OF RECALL</div>

<p>This also may be added. Early in 1813 a
special order was issued by Napoleon to the
army in Spain requiring the Eagles of most of
the regiments to be sent back to France. Napoleon
at that time was in Paris, engaged in getting
together a new Grand Army to replace that
destroyed in Russia. The regiments in Spain,
he said, would be so weakened by the intended
withdrawal of their third, fourth, and fifth
battalions (which he was recalling in order to
send them to Germany for the coming campaign
there), that the Eagles—in charge of the first
battalions which were remaining in Spain—would
be exposed to undue risk. “In future,” he wrote,
“there will in Spain be only one Eagle to each
brigade, that of the senior regiment of the brigade.”
The Eagles withdrawn from Spain,
added the order, would “in the end rejoin the
battalions with the Grand Army in Germany,
as soon as these had been reconstituted afresh
as regiments, with a sufficient force of men to
ensure the safety of the Eagles.” All the cavalry
Eagles were recalled: “No regiment of Cavalry
in Spain is to retain its Eagle. Those who have
not done so are immediately to send theirs to
the dépôt.”</p>

<p>It was due to this order mainly that at
Vittoria, after the overwhelming rout of the
French army, only one Eagle-pole—with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Eagle gone—fell into British hands, although
there had been on the field upwards of 70,000
French soldiers (of whom 55,000 were infantry),
and the French lost everything—in the words
of one of their own generals (Gazan), “all their
equipages, all their guns, all their treasure, all
their stores, all their papers.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> are seventy-five standards of Napoleon’s
Grand Army of 1812 now in Russia, trophies of
the Moscow disaster. Rather more than half
of the number are Eagles. The remainder of
the trophies are battalion and cavalry flags; some
French, some the ensigns of allied contingents
and the troops of vassal states of the Napoleonic
Empire, compelled to take a part in the campaign.
All the European armies of the period are
represented among the trophies: green and
white Saxon flags; blue and white Bavarian
flags; violet and white Polish ensigns; Spanish,
Dutch, and Portuguese colours; Swiss flags;
Westphalian and Baden flags of the Confederation
of the Rhine; the red and black of Würtemburg;
the yellow and black of Austria; the white
and black of Prussia; the green, white, and red
tricolor of Italy.</p>

<p>They are preserved at St. Petersburg, in the
Kazan Cathedral and in the Cathedral of St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Peter and St. Paul. Those in the Kazan Cathedral
are grouped over and round the tomb of the
septuagenarian hero, Kutusoff, who lies buried
on the spot where he knelt in prayer before
setting out to take command as generalissimo
of the national army. Near by, suspended
against the pillars, are the marshal’s bâton of
Davout, and the keys of Hamburg, Leipsic,
Dresden, Rheims, Breda, and Utrecht, similarly
spoils of the Napoleonic war.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MOST OF THE EAGLES GOT THROUGH</div>

<p>The actual Eagle trophies number all told
between forty and fifty: less than a third of the
total array of Eagles that crossed the Niemen at
the head of their regiments on the outbreak of
the war. The majority of the Eagles of the
Grand Army were saved from falling into the
hands of the Russians through the devoted
heroism of those responsible for their safe-keeping
amid the horrors of the retreat. Of those at St.
Petersburg, not more than half at most were
taken in actual combat, and they were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
yielded up by their bearers with life, being picked
up from among the dead bodies, and carried off
by the Russians on going over the field after the
fight was over. Five Eagles only were surrendered
by capitulation. The others were
brought in by the Cossacks, who came upon them
while prowling in rear of the retreating army.
They were found, some in hollow trees, where
their despairing bearers had tried to conceal
them; some in holes dug with bayonets in the
frozen ground underneath the snow. Others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
were dragged to light, broken from their staves,
from beneath the coats or from the knapsacks
of officers and men, who had fallen by the way at
night and been frozen to death, during the final
stage of the retreat between Wilna and the
Niemen. It is in remembrance of how, to the
last, during the Moscow retreat, in many a dark
and hopeless hour, there yet remained detachments
of devoted men, the last remnants of
regiments, at all times ready to stand at bay
and sacrifice themselves for the honour of their
Eagles, amidst hordes of disorganised fugitives
all round—in remembrance of that, the army
of modern France commemorates on the colours
of certain regiments, as representing corps that
bore the same numbers in Napoleon’s Grand
Army in Russia, the names, among others,
of “Marojaroslav,” “Polotz,” “Wiasma,”
“Krasnoi,” “La Berezène,” defeats and disasters
though these were.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT FRANCE REMEMBERS TO-DAY</div>

<p>The Eagles were under fire for the first time in
Russia on July 17, in the attack on Smolensk on
the Dnieper, the ancient Lithuanian capital,
where took place the first important battle of the
war. There the Eagles of Ney’s and Davout’s
corps did their part in inciting the men to add
fresh laurels to the fame of their regiments;
ever prominent in the attack, leading charge after
charge as the columns made repeated efforts to
storm the fortified suburbs and lofty ramparts
of the citadel. The soldiers did all that intrepidity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and desperate valour might attempt,
but in vain. No valour could prevail against the
stubborn endurance of the Russians, who also
occupied a strongly walled position that was
practically impregnable. The fierce contest
went on all through a whole day, until nightfall,
and then, under cover of darkness, the defenders
silently drew off and retreated beyond the city,
leaving Smolensk in flames. No fewer than
15,000 French and 10,000 Russians fell in the
merciless encounter.</p>

<p>Next morning there followed a spectacle
hardly ever perhaps paralleled: the march of
the Grand Army through the streets between the
still blazing houses, “the martial columns advancing
in the finest order to the sound of military
music.” “We traversed between furnaces,”
as an officer puts it, “tramping over the hot and
smouldering ashes, in all the pomp of military
splendour, bands playing and each Eagle leading
its men.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WON ON THE BATTLEFIELD</div>

<p>At Smolensk one regiment won its Eagle, which
Napoleon presented at five o’clock in the morning
on July 19, before the paraded battalions of
Davout’s corps. It was the 127th of the Line;
a regiment, it is curious to note, enrolled a few
months before, from former Hanoverian subjects
of our own King George the Third, and commanded
by French officers as a regular corps of
the French Line. By Napoleon’s latest ordinance,
issued just before the Emperor quitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Paris in May, the regiments newly raised for the
Russian War, of which there were several, were
in each case to win their Eagles on the battlefield.
The Eagle for each regiment was to be
provided in advance, but would be held back,
locked up in the regimental chest, until it “should
be won by distinguished conduct.” The 127th
won their Eagle at Smolensk, their brilliant
service being specially brought before Napoleon
by Marshal Davout, who, of his own initiative,
claimed the Eagle for them from Napoleon.
The regiment bore it with distinction through
the hottest of the fighting at Borodino, carried
it all through the disastrous retreat from Moscow,
and preserved it to the end to go through the
later campaign in Germany, and face the enemy
after that in the last stand before Paris in 1814.
The Eagle was eventually destroyed by order of
the restored Bourbon Government.</p>

<p>The second great battle-day of the Eagles in
the Russian War was at Borodino, on September
7. There a quarter of a million and
more combatants faced each other: on one
side, 132,000 Russians with 640 guns; on the
other, 133,000 French with 590 guns. The
battle of Borodino was perhaps the most sanguinary
and the most obstinately contested in
history. The opening shots were fired at sunrise.
When at sunset both sides drew sullenly
apart, exhausted after twelve hours of carnage,
neither army was victorious. Each held the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
ground on which it had begun the battle;
25,000 men lay dead on the field, and 68,000
more lay wounded, an appalling massacre that
staggered even Napoleon.</p>

<p>Amidst the ferocious savagery of the hand-to-hand
fighting that characterised Borodino all
over the field, many of the Eagles were in
desperate peril. Several were cut off in the
terrible havoc that the ferocious Russian counter-charges
wrought in the French ranks, and were
only saved by the stern fortitude of the soldiers,
fighting at times back to back round the Eagles,
keeping off the enemy with bayonet thrusts till
help should come. In one part of the field the
9th of the Line was isolated and for a time broken
up and scattered. The Eagle-bearer was cut off
by himself and surrounded. He saved the
Eagle, as he fell wounded. “Amidst the confusion,
wounded by two bayonet thrusts, I fell,
but I was able to make an effort to prevent the
Eagle falling into the hands of the enemy. Some
of them rushed at me and closed round, but,
getting to my feet, I managed to fling the Eagle,
staff and all, over their heads towards some of
our men, whom I had caught sight of, fortunately
near by, trying to charge through and rescue the
Eagle. This was all I could do before I fell
again and was made prisoner.” The brave
fellow returned to France two years later, at the
Peace of 1814, and made his way to the regimental
dépôt, where he found barely twenty of his comrades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
at Borodino left. The rest had succumbed
during the retreat from Moscow. The
survivors had brought back the Eagle to France;
only, however, to have to give it up to the new
Minister of War for destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO EAGLES JUST SAVED</div>

<p>The 18th of the Line, broken in a Russian
counter-attack, after storming one of the Russian
redoubts erected to defend part of the position,
rallied with their Eagle in their midst and held
their ground in spite of repeated attacks until
help could get through to them. At the roll-call
next morning, 40 officers out of 50, and
800 men out of 2,000 were reported as missing;
left dead or wounded on the field. Another
regiment lost its colonel and half one battalion
dead on the field; the Eagle-Guard were all
shot down or bayoneted round the Eagle, which
in the end was saved and brought out of the
battle by a corporal, who was awarded a commission
by Napoleon in the presence of the
remains of the regiment next day. The Eagle
of the 61st of the Line again was only kept out
of Russian hands by the devotion of the men
round it. Napoleon rode past the regiment next
day while being paraded for the roll to be called.
Only two battalions were there, and he asked
the colonel where the third battalion was. “It
is in the redoubt, Sire!” was the officer’s reply,
pointing in the direction of the Great Redoubt,
round which some of the hardest fighting of the
day had taken place. The battalion had literally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
been annihilated: not an officer or a man
of the 1,100 in the third battalion of the 61st
had returned from the fight.</p>

<p>A regiment of Cuirassiers lost its Eagle at
Borodino: the Eagle had disappeared in the
midst of a fierce <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>, in which the Eagle-bearer
had gone down. The loss was not discovered
till later. All, however, refused to believe that
it had been captured: that was incredible. The
dead Eagle-bearer’s body was found after the
battle, but no Eagle was there. Overwhelmed
with shame, the regiment had to admit that the
impossible had happened, and during the weeks
that they were at Moscow “they remained
plunged in a profound dolour.” The Eagle
reappeared in an extraordinary way. In the
retreat, when passing the scene of the battle,
a ghastly and horrible spectacle with its unburied
corpses and the carcasses of horses strewn
thickly and heaped up all over the field, a sudden
thought struck one of the officers. Late that
night, he and a brother officer, taking the risk
of capture by Cossacks on the prowl in rear
of the retreating army, rode back and found
their way by moonlight to where the Cuirassiers
had had their fight and the Eagle-bearer had
fallen. They found the Eagle inside the carcass
of the Eagle-bearer’s horse. It had been thrust in
there by the dying Eagle-bearer through the gaping
wound that had killed the horse, as the only
means to conceal it in the midst of the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW THE EAGLES ENTERED MOSCOW</div>

<p>The Eagles made their last triumphant entry
into a conquered capital at Moscow on September
14, the Eagle of the Old Guard leading
the way at the head of the grenadiers of the
Guard, all wearing for the day their full-dress
parade uniform. As has been said, every officer
and soldier of the Guard, by Napoleon’s standing
order, carried a suit of full-dress uniform in
his kit or knapsack on campaign in readiness
for such occasions—“en tenue de parade comme
si elle eut défiler au Carrousel.” They had
marched like that with music and full military
pomp twice through Vienna, and through the
streets of Berlin and Madrid; but there was at
Moscow a disconcerting and ominous difference,
both in their surroundings and in the reception
that they met. Elsewhere, alike in Vienna,
Berlin, and Madrid, the parade march of the
victorious Eagles passed through densely crowded
streets of onlookers, silently gazing with dejected
mien at the scene. At Moscow not a
soul was in the streets, at the windows, anywhere;
on every side were emptiness and desolation.
The inhabitants had fled the city, and
only deserted houses remained. The first incendiary
fires at Moscow broke out at midnight,
within twelve hours of Napoleon taking up his
residence in the Kremlin.</p>

<p>The spell after that was broken. Henceforward
victory deserted the Eagles; the hour
of fate was at hand for Napoleon and the Grand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
Army. The Fortune of War, indeed, turned
against the Eagles even before Napoleon had
quitted Moscow.</p>

<p>Early on October 18, Napoleon, while at
breakfast in the Kremlin, suddenly heard distant
cannonading away to the south. He learned
what had happened that afternoon while holding
a review of the Italian Royal Guard. “We
hastily regained our quarters, packed up our
parade-uniforms, put on our service kit ...
and to the sound of our drums and bands
threaded our way through the streets of Moscow
at five in the afternoon.” During the past five
weeks, while all had been outwardly quiet, the
Russian armies had been manœvring to close in
along the only road of retreat open to Napoleon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST SENT TO THE CZAR</div>

<p>The nearest of the Russian armies, concentrated
to the south-west of Moscow, struck the
first blow on October 18 at daybreak, by surprising
Murat’s cavalry camp near Vinkovo.
The results to the French were disastrous. Two
thousand of Murat’s men were killed and as many
more were taken prisoners. Between thirty and
forty guns were lost, and Murat’s personal camp-baggage
train, which included “his silver canteens
and cooking utensils, in which cats’ and horse flesh
were found prepared for food”—a discovery that
opened the eyes of the Russians to the precarious
position of affairs in Napoleon’s army. Murat
himself, according to one story, “rode off on
the first alarm in his shirt.” He only got away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
according to another, by cutting his way through
the Russians sword in hand, at the head of his
personal escort of carabineers. Two Eagles were
spoils of the surprise; the first to fall into Russian
hands in the war. They were lost in the
general scrimmage, their bearers being sabred
at the outset of the Russian onslaught. The
Eagles were at once sent off to St. Petersburg
to be presented to the Czar Alexander.</p>

<p>On the other hand nine Eagles were saved,
their escorts fighting their way successfully
through the Russians.</p>

<p>Many stories are recorded in memoirs of survivors
of the Grand Army of heroic endeavours
made repeatedly by officers and men to save
their Eagles from the enemy amid the disasters
and horrors of the retreat. Their devotion and
self-sacrifice had their reward in the preservation
of seven Eagles in every ten.</p>

<p>Two Eagles were lost fourteen days after
leaving Moscow, in the disastrous battle at
Wiasma on November 2, halfway on the road
back to Smolensk, where the advanced columns
of the pursuing Russians attacked and all but
cut the retreating French army in two. The
rearguard of the Grand Army, Marshal Davout’s
corps, with the Italian corps of the Viceroy
Eugène Beauharnais, was overpowered and
driven in and broken up; crushed under the
overpowering artillery fire of the Russians. They
left behind 6,000 dead, 2,000 prisoners, and 27<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
guns. Two Eagles were taken, their regiments
being virtually annihilated, but twenty-one were
saved. They were safeguarded through the rout
by groups of brave-hearted officers and men,
who beat off the rushes made at them by the
Russian cavalry and the Cossacks. They fought
their way through until they met Ney’s troops,
who had heard the firing and turned back,
arriving in time to stem and check the Russian
pursuit and enable what was left of the two
shattered army corps to rally under their protection.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“WE HAVE DONE OUR DUTY!”</div>

<p>One infantry regiment at Wiasma perished on
the battlefield to a man, but saved its Eagle.
It was the rearmost of all, and was isolated
and surrounded beyond reach of help. In vain
its men formed square and tried to fight their
way after the rest through the surging masses
of the Russians. They made their way for a
time until the enemy brought up artillery. A
Russian battery galloped up, unlimbered close
to them, and opened fire with murderous effect.
The Frenchmen tried desperately to charge
the guns, but were beaten back by a rush of
cavalry. At last, in despair, they formed square
and faced the cruel slaughter that the guns
made in their ranks, in the hope that help might
reach them. Terms were offered them and
refused. They would not surrender, and fought
on till dusk, when their ammunition gave out.
The Russians were closing round for a final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
decisive charge on the small handful of survivors,
when the wounded colonel, seeing all was
over, made the attempt that saved the Eagle.
The scanty remnant of what had that morning
been a regiment of 3,000 men formed round in a
ring, facing towards the enemy with bayonets
levelled. The Eagle-staff was broken up and
the fragments thrust under the ground. With
flint and steel a match was lighted and the
silken tricolor consumed. The Eagle was then
tied up in a havresac and entrusted to an old
soldier who was known to be a good rider. The
colonel, giving up his own charger to the man,
bade him watch his chance and, as the enemy
came on in the dark, dash through them and
ride his hardest. “Carry the Eagle to his
Majesty,” were the colonel’s words. “Deliver
it to him, and tell him that we have done our
duty!” The man rode off. He was able to
get through the nearest Russians under cover
of the darkness, having to fight his way before
he got clear, and receiving several wounds. Then
his horse fell dead from its injuries. On foot he
stumbled on, and before midnight reached, not
Napoleon, but Marshal Ney, to whom he gave
up his precious charge. No officer or man of
the others of the luckless regiment was ever
heard of in France again. No prisoners from
it ever returned—only the Eagle survived.</p>

<p>Three days after Wiasma the Russian winter
suddenly set in on the doomed host. It brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
about at once the disintegration and disorganisation
of the Grand Army. Already, demoralised
by their privation, hundreds of men
had fallen out of the ranks, flinging away
their muskets and knapsacks, and straggling along
in disorderly groups. A third practically of the
Army ceased to exist as a fighting force within
the first fortnight of the retreat, before the first
snows fell. The others, though, still kept to their
duty. Marching in the ranks day after day,
they strove their hardest to beat back the incessant
attacks of the swarms of Cossacks,
hovering round on the watch to raid the baggage-convoys
at every block or stoppage on the
road. With the coming of the snow the doom of
the Grand Army was sealed. It was impossible
to maintain discipline with the thermometer
at twenty degrees below zero. Men dropped
dead from cold by the score every half-mile.</p>

<p>On November 6 the sun disappeared; a grey
fog enshrouded everything; the frost set in;
and a bitter north wind in howling gusts swept
over the face of the land; with it came down the
snow, falling hour after hour by day and night
without ceasing.</p>

<p>“From that day the Army lost its courage
and its military instinct. The soldier no longer
obeyed his officer. The officer separated himself
from his general. The disbanded regiments
marched in disorder. In their frantic search
for food they spread themselves over the plain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
pillaging and destroying whatever fell in their
way.” So a survivor wrote.</p>

<p>The snow came down “in large broad flakes,
which at once chilled and blinded the soldiers:
the marchers, however, stumbled forward, men
often struggling and at last sinking in holes
and ravines that were concealed from them by
the new and disguised appearance of the country.
Those who yet retained discipline and kept
their ranks stood some chance of receiving
assistance; but amid the mass of stragglers,
the men’s hearts, intent only on self-preservation,
became hardened and closed against every feeling
of sympathy and compassion. The storm-wind
lifted the snow from the earth, as well as that
steadily pelting down from above, into dizzy
eddies round the soldiers. Many were hurled
to the ground in this manner, while the
same snow furnished them with an instant
grave, under which they were concealed until
the next summer came, to display their ghastly
remains in the open air.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHEN THE COSSACKS GOT TO WORK</div>

<p>The Cossacks redoubled their attacks on the
retreating army after Wiasma. They had
harassed the French incessantly from the day
after Napoleon passed Mojaisk, but after Wiasma
their audacity increased a hundredfold. They
captured prisoners hourly, from among the
stragglers mostly; in droves, by fifties and
hundreds at a time. Day after day they hung
on the flanks, swooping down with loud shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
on the unfortunate wretches, rounding them up
like sheep, and driving them before them towards
their own camps at the points of their long
lances. Many they killed on the spot, or
stripped naked to perish in the snow. Others
they drove along to the nearest camp of Kutusoff’s
regulars for the sake of the money reward
offered for prisoners brought in alive. Others
again, to save themselves the trouble of driving
them all the way to the army camp, they handed
over to peasants in the villages, selling them
at a rouble a head, for the peasants to make
sport of and maltreat or kill. The brutalities and
ruthless devastations that the French army
had committed in its advance to Moscow had
infuriated the Russian peasantry. Intent on
vengeance they now made use of their opportunity
to the full. They burned alive some of
their captives, by tossing them into pits half
filled with blazing pine-logs. Seventy were
done to death in this horrible way in one village.
Others they buried up to their necks in the
ground and left to die; or else tied them to
trees for the wolves to tear to pieces.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Others
they clubbed or flogged to death, tying down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the wretched Frenchmen to logs on the ground,
hounding on the women and children to hammer
their heads to pieces with thick sticks. A
common method of Cossacks and peasants alike
for making prisoners was to light great watch-fires
at night, a little way off from the retreating
column, and as the frozen and starving
stragglers came crowding up to the blaze they
surrounded them and carried them off wholesale.</p>

<p>After the snow set in, guns and baggage-wagons
were abandoned to the Cossacks at
almost every hundred yards. It was impossible
for the weakened and dying horses to drag
them along; even to keep their footing on the
frozen ground. Within the first week after
Wiasma the appalling number of 30,000 horses
either died of starvation, there being no way of
getting fodder for them because of the snow,
or were frozen to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES OF NEY’S CORPS</div>

<p>In spite of everything, some of the regiments
still kept together and marched in military
formation, with their Eagles at their head;
those in particular of Marshal Ney’s corps.
They formed the rearguard and chief protection
to the army from Wiasma onwards; held
together by the heroic example and personality
of their indefatigable leader, ever present where
there was fighting, ever calm and confident, and
ready with words of encouragement. Not an Eagle
was lost along the line of march between Moscow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and Smolensk by Ney’s men; rallying round
them to beat off the Cossack attacks time and
again with the cry, “Aux Aigles! Voici les
Cosaques!”</p>

<p>This incident, not unlike the cuirassier ride
to recover the Eagle left on the field at Borodino,
is said to have taken place between Wiasma
and Smolensk. One regiment of Ney’s cavalry
missed its Eagle after a sharp fight on the road,
the Eagle-bearer having apparently fallen during
the encounter, unseen by the survivors. That
night round the bivouac fire lots were drawn,
and two officers rode back amid blinding snow
squalls to try to find the Eagle. They successfully
evaded the Cossacks and made their
way ten miles back to the scene of the combat,
where, after scaring off some wolves, they
searched in the snow and found the dead officer’s
body with the Eagle by its side. They brought
it back safely to the regiment and restored it
to their comrades. Their limbs were frost-bitten
and rigid from cold, so that they had to be
lifted off their horses, but the brave men were
content—they had saved their Eagle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SO FAR TEN EAGLES LOST</div>

<p>At Krasnoi, on November 19, between
Smolensk and the Beresina, Napoleon underwent
another severe defeat from the pursuing
Russians, 10,000 prisoners and 70 guns falling
into the victors’ hands. Two Eagles were
carried off from the battlefield and despatched
to St. Petersburg by special courier, together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
with Kutusoff’s report to the Czar. Twenty-seven
Eagles, however, got past the Russians,
fighting their way through, thanks to the endurance
of brave men who rallied round them.
Krasnoi it was that gave the death-blow to
Napoleon’s last hope of rallying the Grand Army.
After it less than 30,000 men remained under
arms with the main column, including the
8,000 survivors of the Imperial Guard. Up to
then, according to the Russian official returns,
80,000 prisoners, 500 guns, and “40 standards
and flags of all kinds” had fallen into the hands
of the pursuers. Not more than ten, however,
of the forty standards taken were Eagles: the
two taken at Murat’s surprise at Vinkovo; the
two taken at Wiasma; the two taken at Krasnoi;
also two taken before Napoleon reached
Smolensk, from a brigade sent from Smolensk
to help him on the road, which blundered into
the middle of the Russian army and had to
surrender; and two captured elsewhere, from
the French flanking armies of Marshal Macdonald
and Marshal St. Cyr. An eleventh
Eagle was taken in the second battle at Krasnoi,
from Ney’s rearguard; the only Eagle that Ney
actually lost in fight throughout the 600 miles’
march between Moscow and the frontier.</p>

<p>At Krasnoi, Ney’s rearguard, following at a
day’s march behind the rest of the army, found
its way barred. The Russians, after defeating
Napoleon’s main column, a day’s march in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
advance, had waited on the scene of the former
fighting for Ney. They held a position that it
was practically impossible for Ney’s comparatively
small force to get past. After vainly
attempting to break through, Ney had to draw
back, and make a forlorn-hope effort to avoid
destruction by a long détour, in the course of
which he had to abandon guns, baggage, and
horses, and cross the Dnieper on ice hardly thick
enough to bear the weight of a man.</p>

<p>On the eve of Krasnoi, indeed, the rearguard
found itself in so desperate a position, that Ney
ordered all its Eagles to be destroyed. His
regiments had suffered so severely in their continuous
fighting, that it was impossible adequately
to safeguard the Eagles. Every musket
and bayonet was wanted in the fighting line.
It was impossible to supply sufficient Eagle-escorts.
So far, in spite of the dreadful straits
to which some of the regiments had been reduced,
all had marched openly with their Eagles, and
fought round them, guarding them sedulously
by night and day. “When excess of fatigue
constrained us to take a few moments of repose,”
describes Colonel De Fesenzac of the 4th of the
Line, “we (what was left of the regiment able
to carry arms—not 100 men) assembled together
in any place where we could find shelter, a few
of the men standing by to mount guard for the
protection of the regimental Eagle.”</p>

<p>“Then,” describes the colonel, “came the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
order that all the Eagles should be broken up and
buried. As I could not make up my mind to
this, I directed that the staff should be burned,
and that the Eagle of the 4th Regiment should
be stowed in the knapsack of one of the Eagle-bearers,
by whose side I kept my post on the
march.” The Eagle of the 4th, it may be added
by the way, was the identical Eagle that Napoleon
had presented to the regiment in place of
that lost at Austerlitz, in exchange for, as has
been told, two captured Austrian flags.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THEY OUGHT TO PERISH WITH US”</div>

<p>Other officers did the same as Colonel De
Fesenzac. One officer, however, the colonel of
the 18th of the Line, flatly refused to have his
regimental Eagle either broken up or hidden
away. “The Eagle,” he says in his journal,
which still exists, “had throughout, until then,
been carried at the head of the regiment, and I
declined to obey the order on behalf of the 18th.
It seemed to us a monstrous ignominy. Our
Eagles were not given us to be made away with
or hidden: they ought to perish with us.” The
Eagle of the 18th did actually perish with the
regiment. In the rearguard repulse at Krasnoi
the entire regiment was destroyed, except for
some twenty survivors, including the colonel,
severely wounded. “Our Eagle,” says the gallant
colonel, proudly recording its fate, “remained
among our dead on the field of battle.”</p>

<p>That Eagle of the 18th was the only one of
Marshal Ney’s Eagles to fall into the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
the Russians in battle. Some ten of the Eagles
now at St. Petersburg were found on the bodies
of officers and men who had been either frozen
to death or had fallen dead on the march during
Ney’s retreat after Krasnoi; they were not taken
in fight.</p>

<p>Ney rejoined Napoleon with only 1,500 men
left out of 12,000, of which the rearguard had
consisted when it left Smolensk. It was while
making his last effort to get past the Russians
after his attempt to break through at Krasnoi
had failed, that Ney, overtaken on the banks of
the half-frozen Dnieper on the evening before he
risked his perilous crossing, and summoned by
the Russians to surrender, made that proudly
defiant reply which has ever since been a treasured
memory to the French Army: “A Marshal of
France never surrenders!” Six hours later he
had evaded capture and, with the remnant of
his corps, was across the river. All the world
has heard how Napoleon, hopeless of seeing him
again, welcomed Ney with the words: “I have
three hundred millions of francs in the vaults of
the Tuileries; I would have given them all for
Marshal Ney!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALL KEPT TOGETHER FOR SAFETY</div>

<p>The remaining Eagles had by now been assembled
for preservation under the protection
of what troops of the main column, which
Napoleon accompanied, still continued under
arms. Further effort to rally the shattered host
was beyond possibility. Only portions of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
two army corps of Marshals Victor and Oudinot,
called in from holding the line of communications,
still retained military formation, together with
the reduced battalions of the Old Guard which
had kept near Napoleon throughout. To save
the remaining Eagles, the officers of broken-up
and disbanded regiments, with some devoted
soldiers who stood by them, took personal charge
of the Eagles, and carried them with their own
hands. Banding together and marching in company
side by side, they tramped on, plodding
through the snow day and night for 200 miles;
the collected Eagles all massed in the centre.
They attached themselves to the column of the
Old Guard, and kept their way close by Napoleon.</p>

<p>A survivor of the retreat from Moscow, in his
memoirs, describes how he saw Napoleon and the
Eagles pass by him on the way to the Beresina
on the morning of November 25:</p>

<p>“Those in advance seemed to be generals, a
few on horseback, but the greater part on foot.
There was also a great number of other officers,
the remnant of the Doomed Squadron and Battalion,
formed on the 22nd and barely existing
at the end of three days. Those on foot dragged
themselves painfully along, almost all of them
having their feet frozen and wrapped in rags or
in bits of sheep’s-skin, and all nearly dying of
hunger. Afterwards came the small remains
of the Cavalry of the Guard. The Emperor
came next, on foot, and carrying a staff. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
wore a large cloak lined with fur, and had a red
velvet cap with black-fox fur on his head. Murat
walked on foot at his right, and on his left the
Prince Eugène, Viceroy of Italy. Next came
the Marshals Berthier—Prince of Neufchatel—Ney,
Mortier, Lefebvre, with other marshals and
generals whose corps had been annihilated.</p>

<p>“The Emperor mounted a horse as soon as he
had passed; so did a few of those with him:
the greater part of them had no horses to ride.
Seven or eight hundred officers and non-commissioned
officers followed, walking in order and
perfect silence, and carrying the Eagles of their
different regiments, which had so often led them
to victory. This was all that remained of 60,000
men.</p>

<p>“After them came the Imperial Guard on
foot, marching also in order.”</p>

<p>Four Eagles were lost in the fighting at the
passage of the Beresina, where a whole division
of Marshal Victor’s corps (General Partonneaux’s)
was cut off and compelled to surrender.
On the last night, when either massacre under
the Russian guns or laying down their arms was
all that was left to them, they broke up and
buried their Eagles in the ground underneath
the snow. The officers of one regiment, it is
told, broke up their Eagle before burying it,
burned the flag at their last bivouac fire, mixed
the ashes with thawed snow, and swallowed the
concoction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WHEN THE LAST HOPE WAS GONE</div>

<p>The little column of officers with their Eagles
passed the Beresina with the Guard, and thus
escaped that last catastrophe, the crowning
horror of the bridge disaster, when 24,000 ill-fated
human beings were sent to their account;
either killed in the fighting with the Russians,
or drowned in the river, jammed together on the
burning bridge, while the Russian guns from the
rear thundered on them with shot and shell.</p>

<p>The officer-escort with the Eagles tramped on
until Wilna was reached; until after Napoleon
had left the army and set off for Paris. Then,
on the final falling apart of the remnants of the
stricken host, the officers themselves dispersed,
to escape as best they could individually and
get to the Niemen; breaking up the Eagle-poles
and concealing the Eagles and flags in knapsacks
or under their uniforms. The dispersal, says one
officer, was at Napoleon’s own instance. “He
ordered all the officers who had no troops to make
the best of their way at once to the Niemen,
considering that their services had best be saved
for the future army he was going to Paris to raise
and organise.” That is one story. According to
another officer, utter despair at their frightful
position, abandoned by their chief, was the cause
of the break-up at Wilna and the final <i lang="fr">débâcle</i>.
“Until then a few armed soldiers, led by their
officers, had still rallied round the Eagles. Now,
however, the officers began to break away, and
the soldiers became fewer and fewer, and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
left were finally reduced, of necessity, some to
conceal the Eagles in knapsacks, others to make
away with them.” Some of the officers fell dead
on the way to the Niemen, struck down suddenly
by the cold, and their Eagles remained
with them. Others who died, with their last
strength tried to put their charges beyond reach
of the enemy by scraping or digging holes in
the frozen ground, and burying the Eagles.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLE OF THE OLD GUARD</div>

<p>The Eagle of the Old Guard recrossed the
Niemen at Kovno, while Ney was making his
final stand, defending the gate of the town; the
marshal fighting musket in hand at the last,
with less than twenty soldiers. That Eagle was
still carried openly—the only one still so displayed—carried
defiantly aloft on its staff, borne
to the last with its escort in military formation,
in the midst of the ranks of the 400 men of the
Old Guard who were all that were able to reach
the frontier.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_291"><span class="smcap">At Bay in Northern Germany—1813</span></h3>

<p>There were yet dark days in store for the Eagles
after the retreat from Moscow was over. The
tale of their misfortunes was not yet ended.
There was yet to be the sequel to the great
catastrophe; further humiliations in the War
in Germany of 1813, and the Winter Campaign
of 1814 in Eastern France, which followed as
the consequence and result of the overthrow in
Russia.</p>

<p>No fewer than fifteen of the Eagles that the
devotion of their officers brought through the
retreat from Moscow are now—making allowance
for difficulties of identification, owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
defective records—among the trophies of victory
to be seen at Berlin and Potsdam, in Vienna, and
also at St. Petersburg. Those in Germany are
mostly kept in the Garrison Church of Potsdam,
suspended triumphantly above the vault in which
lies the sarcophagus of Frederick the Great.
They were placed there of set purpose as an act
of retribution, as a votive offering to the <i lang="la">manes</i>
of the Great Frederick; as a Prussian rejoinder
to Napoleon’s act of wanton desecration after
Jena. The four trophy Eagles at Vienna are
in the Imperial Arsenal Museum there. Two
of them are the spoils of Kulm; displayed together
with the keys of Lyons, Langres, Troyes,
and the fortress of Mayence, which were surrendered
during the march of the Allies on Paris.
The Russian trophy Eagles of 1813 are at St.
Petersburg, displayed with the Eagles which fell
into Russian hands in the retreat from Moscow.</p>

<p>What the annihilation of the Grand Army in
Russia meant for Europe, with what dramatic
rapidity its import for the vassal states of
Napoleon was realised and turned to account,
is a familiar story. Prussia led the revolt at
once, and all Northern Germany rose in arms <i lang="fr">en
masse</i> to commence the “War of Liberation,”
joining hands with Russia as the pursuing armies
of the Czar crossed the frontier. Then Austria,
after negotiations rendered abortive at the last
by Napoleon’s infatuated pride and overweening
self-confidence, threw her sword into the balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
and turned the scale decisively against France.
Napoleon’s hastily raised conscript levies, outnumbered
and outmanœuvred, were defeated
on battlefield after battlefield, and driven in
rout across the Rhine to their final surrender
at the gates of Paris; and then came the abdication
of Fontainebleau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES DIED HARD</div>

<p>Yet, with all that, in those dark hours of their
fate the Eagles died hard. The trophy-collections
of Berlin, Vienna, and St. Petersburg
testify to that. Only a percentage of the Eagles
which faced their fate on the battlefield became
spoils to the victors. Marshal Macdonald’s army,
routed by Blücher on the Katzbach, thanks to
the devotion of the regimental officers and
some of their men, saved all its Eagles from
the enemy except three. Ney’s army, no less
roughly handled at Dennewitz, managed to
retain in like manner all its Eagles except three.
Vandamme’s army, annihilated and dispersed
at Kulm, saved its Eagles all but two. Oudinot
was routed at Gross Beeren, with the loss of guns
and many prisoners; Gérard underwent the same
fate near Magdeburg; Bertrand was surprised
and defeated with heavier losses still; but not
one Eagle was left as spoil of these disasters
in the hands of the victorious foe.</p>

<p>In one battle the Eagle of Napoleon’s Irish
Legion was only just kept from being to-day
among the trophies displayed in the Garrison
Church of Potsdam over the tomb of Frederick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the Great. It was immediately after Macdonald’s
defeat on the Katzbach. The Irish
Legion was one of the regiments in one of Macdonald’s
divisions, that of General Puthod.
They had had a hard fight of it, and their retreat
was barred by the river Bober in flood. Under
stress of the continuous attacks of the Prussians
in ever-increasing force, the 12,000 men of
Puthod’s Division had been reduced to barely
5,000. They had used up their last cartridges,
and had been driven back to the
river-bank, where the Prussian army closed in
on them “in a half-moon.” The Prussians
halted for one moment until they realised that
the troops before them had no more ammunition.
Then, aware that they had their foe at their mercy,
they rushed forward, cheering exultantly, to
deliver the <i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i>. “All of a sudden,”
describes an Irish officer, “30,000 men ran forward
on their prey, of whom none but those who
knew how to swim could attempt to escape.”
The greater number of the French, all the same,
jumped into the river, and took the risk of
drowning rather than surrender. Less than
five hundred got across the stream, and after
that they had to wade waist-deep for half a mile
over flooded marshes under a pitiless fire from
the Prussian batteries. In the end only 150
men reached dry ground alive. Among the
survivors were just 40 men of the Irish Legion,
with their Eagle—Colonel Ware, eight officers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
the Eagle-bearer, and thirty privates. The
Irish remnant made their way eventually to
Dresden, and reported themselves to Napoleon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IRISH EAGLE’S FIRST ESCAPE</div>

<p>That adventure, by the way, was the Irish
Eagle’s second escape from falling into an
enemy’s hands since Napoleon presented it to
the Legion on the Field of Mars. On the first
occasion it came within an ace of being now
among our British trophy Eagles at Chelsea; of,
indeed, being the first Napoleonic Eagle to be
brought as spoil of war to England. The Irish
Legion was in garrison at Flushing in 1809, when
the fortress surrendered to the British Walcheren
Expedition. On the night before the final
capitulation, Major Lawless of the Irish Legion
took charge of the Eagle, and in a rowing-boat
made a risky passage among the British ships
of war in front of the batteries. He escaped up
the Scheldt to Antwerp, where he delivered the
Eagle personally to Marshal Bernadotte. Napoleon
sent for the major to Paris, decorated him
for saving the Eagle, with the Cross of the Legion
of Honour, and promoted him lieutenant-colonel.</p>

<p>In the disaster on the Bober also, a soldier of
the 134th of the Line saved the Eagle of another
regiment, the 147th. The two regiments, as the
Prussians charged down on them after their
cartridges gave out, in desperation rushed to
meet their assailants with the bayonet. They
were overpowered and hurled back in confusion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
to the bank of the river, all intermingled in the
<i lang="fr">mêlée</i>. The Eagle-bearer of the 147th fell dead,
shot down, and a Prussian officer made for the
Eagle. A soldier of the 134th bayoneted the
officer as he got to it, picked up the Eagle, and,
seeing only more Prussians round him, flung himself,
still holding on to the Eagle, into the river.
The man could not swim, and was fired at as he
floundered in the water, but he was not hit.
Unable to reach the other side, he somehow got
on to a shallow patch, and, still holding fast to
the Eagle, kept his footing there, until, to get
away from the hail of bullets all round him, he
again risked drowning by trying to drift downstream.
He managed to keep his head above
water, and got over to a bed of rushes, fringing
the farther bank. Creeping in there, still holding
on closely to the Eagle, the brave fellow hid for
six hours until dark, embedded in mud to his
armpits most of the time. After nightfall he
worked his way through and crawled ashore.
Finally, after wandering across country for eight
days, feeding on berries and what he could pick
up, in constant peril of discovery among the
hostile peasants and parties of Prussian dragoons
scouring the district, the heroic soldier at length
found his way to Dresden. There he was
brought before Marshal Berthier, to whom he
delivered the Eagle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE COST OF HIS LIFE</div>

<p>At the battle of the Katzbach the colonel of
the 132nd of the Line threw away his life under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the mistaken impression that he saw the Eagle
of his regiment captured by the enemy. He was
short-sighted, and suddenly missed it in the
middle of a charge. Thinking he saw the Eagle
being carried off by a party of Prussians he rode
straight through the enemy at them, to fall
mortally wounded halfway, with his horse shot
beneath him. Some of the men saw the colonel
fall, and charged after him. They got to him
and carried him off the field, and in the retreat
until a place of safety was reached, where the
survivors of the regiment had rallied. There
the officers came round to bid farewell to their
dying chief. The Eagle-bearer of the regiment
was among them, and he, to the amazement of
all, produced the Eagle from his havresac,
broken from its staff, and held it up before the
eyes of the dying colonel. No enemy’s hand, he
declared, had contaminated it. Finding himself
and the Eagle, he explained, in imminent danger
of capture, he had wrenched the Eagle off the
staff and hidden it—his act causing the disappearance
which the colonel had marked, and
which had resulted in his fatal dash among the
enemy.</p>

<p>The 17th of the Line saved their Eagle and
themselves after Vandamme’s defeat at Kulm,
and made their way to safety, as one of the
officers relates, after an extraordinary series
of adventures. They had joined Vandamme’s
army at the beginning of the first day’s fighting—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
battle lasted three days—coming in after
a week’s march from Dresden, through pouring
rain most of the time. They numbered four
battalions, 4,000 men in all. Vandamme was
successful on the first two days and the 17th
by themselves routed an Austrian regiment
and captured a gun. On the evening of the
second day the French advanced again, driving
the enemy before them into the valley of Kulm.
They bivouacked on the ground they had won,
anticipating a final triumph on the morrow.
But during that night two Russian and Prussian
army corps reinforced the Austrian columns
unknown to the French.</p>

<p>One of the officers of the 17th, Major Fantin
des Odoards, during the night had his suspicions
aroused about the enemy, and made a discovery;
but Vandamme would not listen to him.</p>

<p>He was unable to sleep, says Major Fantin,
and, learning from a patrol that mysterious
sounds were being heard in the direction in
which the Austrians had retreated, he left the
bivouac and went out alone beyond the outposts,
to creep in the dark towards the Austrian
watch-fires. At times, as he crawled forward,
describes the major, he lay flat and listened with
his ear to the ground. In the end he felt certain
that he heard the tramp and stir of a vast number
of men, and also the rumble of artillery wheels
moving across the front. Apparently, from the
direction the unseen troops were taking, they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
marching to cut off the retreat of the army from
Dresden, Napoleon’s base of operations throughout
the campaign.</p>

<p>Major Fantin returned to the bivouac and
went at once to report to the general, finding
him asleep. He aroused Vandamme and told
what he had heard and suspected; only, however,
to be rebuffed and rudely answered that he was
quite mistaken. Vandamme, a surly and ill-conditioned
boor to deal with at all times,
awoke in a vile temper. “You are a fool!”
was what he said in reply. “If the enemy are
on the move at all, they are in retreat, trying
to escape me. To-morrow will see them flying,
or my prisoners.” With that Vandamme terminated
the interview, and turned over and
went to sleep again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HEMMED IN ON EVERY SIDE</div>

<p>He found out his mistake all too soon. Daylight
disclosed dense swarms of Austrians, Prussians,
and Russians in front of Vandamme, on
his flanks, and closing on his rear; outnumbering
him nearly four to one. It was a desperate
position, for the only road by which Vandamme
might retreat was held by the enemy. Little
time was left to him to deliberate what to do.
He was in the act of forming up his columns
in a mass to try to fight his way through, when
the enemy attacked in overpowering force.
Before noon that day, out of 30,000 men, 10,000
had fallen. Seven thousand more were wounded
or prisoners. The rest were fugitives, flying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
for shelter and hiding-places in the woods
round the battlefield. All the French guns
and baggage had been taken, and Vandamme
himself was a prisoner, together with many
officers of rank. The “annals of modern warfare
record few instances of defeat more complete
than that of Vandamme at Kulm.”</p>

<p>The only regiment that kept its order was
the 17th, and it before the crisis had lost
heavily. Its colonel and two of the <i lang="fr">chefs de
bataillon</i> had been killed; the two others were
wounded. Only some 1,700 of the 4,000 men
remained. It rested with Major Fantin, as
senior officer, to save those that were left and
the Eagle.</p>

<p>The 17th were on the extreme right of the
battle, where they had been posted as support
to Vandamme’s artillery. They held their
ground as long as possible, but the enemy closed
in on them, overlapping them on both flanks,
and then stormed and captured the guns. The
17th were isolated and in imminent peril—surrender
or destruction were the only alternatives
before them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“EN HAUT L’AIGLE!”</div>

<p>Looking round, the major, as he describes,
marked a wooded hill some little way off, and
decided to make for that. There was just time
to get away before the enemy closed in on
them. He sent off all his tirailleurs, about
400 men, to skirmish and hold in check the
advancing Austrians. As they went off he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
shouted to the rest: “En haut l’Aigle!
Ralliement au drapeau!” (“Display the Eagle!
All rally to the standard!”) The men of the
regiment formed round him quickly, and the
major pointed out the wooded hill to them with
his sword. “All of you disperse at once,” he
told them, “and make your way there as quickly
as you can. You will find the Eagle of the regiment
there, and me with it!” The 17th broke
up and scattered, and, under the protection of
the skirmishers, aided by the opportune mist
which hung low over the ground after the heavy
rains of the past week, they made off in groups
in the direction pointed out. All just got past
the enemy in time, Major Fantin and two
officers accompanying the Eagle.</p>

<p>An hour later, “<i lang="fr">nos débris</i>,” as the major
puts it, were straggling up the hill, where they
again rallied round the Eagle. The skirmishers,
cleverly withdrawn at the right moment, evaded
the enemy also, and most of them joined their
comrades on the hill, where all silently drew
together. They then moved off, to halt for
concealment in a wooded glade behind. They
stayed there, keeping quiet and lying down
beside their arms, for several hours; off the
track of the pursuit, and undiscovered by the
enemy. “We were all very hungry and without
anything but what cartridges we had still
left.”</p>

<p>At nightfall they moved away in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
in which Dresden was judged to be, without
having a single map or anything to guide them.
They marched all night, mostly by a forest road,
and keeping their direction by means of occasional
glimpses of the stars seen through rifts
in the cloudy sky overhead. More than once
they had to halt as the enemy were heard on
the move not far off. They groped their way
forward with extreme caution, not a light being
struck, and the necessary words of command
being spoken in an undertone, until after midnight.
Then they suddenly came into the
open round a bend of the road, and discovered,
not half a mile off in front, the numerous watch-fires
of a large body of troops. “The column
halted at the sight like one man and stood in
absolute silence. Who were those in front of
us? Friends or the enemy?”</p>

<p>Two scouts were sent forward to try to find
out. They were away for half an hour; an
interval of intense suspense and anxiety to the
others. At the end of the time the two scouts
came rushing back. They brought unexpectedly
good news. It was a French bivouac: that of
the 14th Army Corps—Marshal St. Cyr’s. So
the 17th and their Eagle were saved.</p>

<p>Other Eagles that got away from the rout at
Kulm and rejoined the army owed their safety
to the determination of small groups of officers
and men who cut their way through the enemy.
“Officers fought with their swords, privates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
with their bayonets and the butts of their
muskets: and as the struggle was to escape
and not to destroy, a push and wrestle, or a blow,
which might suffice to throw the individual
struck out of the way of the striker, prevented
in many instances the more deadly thrust.”
Finally, as the 17th had done, they found
shelter among the woods and ravines of the neighbourhood,
and lay low there until the enemy
had moved off towards Töplitz, whereupon they
made their way to Dresden. The cavalry saved
their Eagles by cutting their way through the
enemy. They suffered heavy losses, but succeeded
in their effort. Their commander,
General Corbineau, “presented himself, wounded
and covered with blood, before Napoleon”; it
was his arrival that announced the disaster.
The Eagles of the 33rd and the 106th of the
Line taken at Kulm are at Vienna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLE-TROPHIES OF LEIPSIC</div>

<p>The three days of battle at Leipsic, between
October 16 and 19, 1813, cost Napoleon 60,000
men in killed, wounded, and prisoners, and 300
guns; but not more than 6 Eagles were among
the trophies of battalion-flags and squadron-colours
taken or found on the field, now at
Berlin, Vienna, and St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>One Eagle was lost during the first day’s
fighting at Leipsic—taken on the 16th by
Blücher from Ney’s corps; but no others were
lost until the end. The 80,000 men who were
able to make good their retreat with Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
across the bridge over the Elster before it was
prematurely blown up, through a non-commissioned
officer’s blunder, carried their Eagles
with them. What colour-trophies came into
the possession of the Allies were taken amid
the final scenes of carnage; from cut-off battalions
of the three divisions left behind on the right
bank of the river, victims of the destruction of
the bridge. They were mostly captured in the
ferocious hand-to-hand fighting which marked
the closing phase of the battle in the suburbs of
Leipsic. The French defended themselves there
to the last with the courage of despair among
the fortified villas and loopholed garden walls.
“Pressed upon by superior numbers, and
fighting, now in the streets, now in the houses,
now through gardens or other enclosures, the
single end which they could accomplish or which
in point of fact they seemed to desire, was that
they might sell their lives at the dearest rate
possible.” Two at least of the Eagles now at
Berlin were hastily buried in gardens during
the last stand, and were dug up there later when
the ground was being turned over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMIDST THE ROUT AT LEIPSIC</div>

<p>Forced to give back before their ever-increasing
enemies, not a few of the French “preferred
death to captivity, and fought to the last. These,
retiring through by-lanes and covered passages,
made their way to the river, some where the
ruins of the bridge covered its banks, some above
and others below that point, and, plunging into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the deep water, endeavoured to gain the opposite
shore by swimming, an attempt in which comparatively
few succeeded.”</p>

<p>The three doomed divisions of Lauriston,
Regnier, and Poniatowski, who were cut off by
the blowing up of the bridge, had, as it happened,
not many Eagles among them to lose. They
were largely made up of newly raised conscript
regiments to whom Napoleon had not yet awarded
Eagles; regiments not yet entitled to carry
Eagles, according to the later regulations that
Napoleon had laid down. Only four of the newly
raised regiments altogether, so far during the
campaign in Germany, had qualified for the
honour. They had received their Eagles with
the customary ceremony at the hands of Napoleon:
three of them on October 15, the day
before the battle of Leipsic opened. The fourth
had received its Eagle at Dresden a month
earlier. Two of these four Eagles only were lost
to the enemy at Leipsic.</p>

<p>The Eagle-bearers of four or five other regiments
among those cut off by the bridge disaster
tried to swim across the Elster with their Eagles.
Their fate is unknown; probably they were
drowned in the attempt. Other Eagle-bearers,
before surrendering, were seen to fling their
Eagles into the river to sink there.</p>

<p>How one Eagle, during the battle on the 18th,
was momentarily lost, and then regained by a
splendid act of valour, is told by Caulaincourt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
who was on Napoleon’s staff, and witnessed the
gallant deed that won the Eagle back. In the
midst of the fighting, a number of Saxon regiments
abandoned Napoleon’s cause and went over <i lang="fr">en
masse</i> to the enemy. To signalise their defection
they turned on the nearest French regiment and
mobbed it; attacking it at close quarters with
the bayonet. Thrown into confusion by the
unexpected onslaught, the French were for the
moment broken and forced back, whereupon the
Saxons, making for the Eagle, got possession of
it. “A young officer of Hussars,” relates Caulaincourt,
“whose name I forget, rushed headlong
into the enemies’ ranks. In the charge some of
the miserable renegades had carried off one of
our Eagles. The gallant young officer rescued it,
but at the cost of his life. He threw the Eagle
at the Emperor’s feet, and then he himself fell,
mortally wounded and bathed in blood. The
Emperor was deeply moved. ‘With such men,’
he exclaimed, ‘what resources does not France
possess!’”</p>

<p>The regiments left by Napoleon to garrison
the fortresses in Germany, at Stettin, at Magdeburg,
Torgau, Dantzic, and elsewhere, previous
to surrendering took steps to prevent their
Eagles falling into the hands of their adversaries.
In every case they destroyed them, smashing the
Eagles into small fragments, which were either
distributed among officers and men, or else
thrown into the ditch of the fortress. In more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
than one case they melted the Eagles down, and
broke up and buried the metal, while the flags
were burned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEPT FROM THE HANDS OF THE FOE</div>

<p>At Dresden, where Marshal St. Cyr had to
surrender, a month after Leipsic, the terms
granted by the Austrian general conducting the
siege allowed the troops to return to France
with their arms, their baggage, and their Eagles,
seven in number. Superior authority, however,
cancelled the privilege. The garrison had already
started on their march when, to their utter consternation,
the capitulation was abruptly annulled
by the Austrian Generalissimo, Schwartzenberg,
with the result that the hapless troops were
compelled to yield themselves prisoners at discretion.
The soldiers were defenceless and could
only submit to their hard fate. They did not,
however, let their seven Eagles pass into the
enemy’s hands. Five of the seven were broken
up, and the flags torn to pieces and divided among
the regiments. Two of the Eagles, those of the
25th of the Line and the 85th, were concealed
intact by two officers, who kept them from discovery
for months, while they were prisoners in
Hungary. After the Peace, in the following
year, they brought them back to France—to
meet there the doom that awaited all the Eagles
of Napoleon of which the officials of the Bourbon
<i lang="fr">régime</i> got possession.</p>

<p>One memento of the Winter Campaign in
Eastern France is now at the Invalides—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Eagle of the 5th of the Line. It was found in
the river Aube at Arcis after the battle there,
which, in its result, decided the fate of Napoleon;
its outcome being the immediate march of the
Allied armies on Paris. The 5th was one of the
regiments of the rearguard column, under Oudinot,
half of which was drowned in the river in
trying to get across at night, after stubbornly
holding out in the town all the afternoon in
order to enable Napoleon to cross the river in
safety. The 5th was one of the regiments that
sacrificed themselves. Its Eagle-bearer was
among the drowned, and his Eagle sank with him.
It remained in the bed of the stream until long
afterwards, when it was accidentally discovered,
and fished up.</p>

<p>The 132nd of the Line of the modern army of
France commemorates on its flag a feat of arms
done under the Eagle of the old 132nd of Napoleon’s
Army, after having been saved from the
Prussians at the Katzbach, and again at Leipsic.
It was in one of the fights in the closing campaign
in Eastern France. The proud legend inscribed
in golden letters, “Rosny, 1814: Un contre
huit,” commemorates how the regiment, single-handed,
held at bay and beat off an enemy eight
times its force, saving itself for the third time,
and its Eagle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GRAND ARMY’S LAST PARADE</div>

<p>The surviving Eagles of the war, the last
to face the enemy in the north of those presented
on the Field of Mars, paid their last salute to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
War Lord at Napoleon’s final review of the
remnants of the Grand Army at Rheims on
March 15, 1814.</p>

<p>A pitiful, a moving, sight was that hapless
military spectacle: the closing parade before
Napoleon of his last remaining soldiers.</p>

<p>This is how Alison describes it: “How different
from the splendid military spectacles of the
Tuileres or Chammartin, which had so often
dazzled his sight with the pomp of apparently
irresistible power! Wasted away to half the
numbers which they possessed when they crossed
the Marne a fortnight before, the greater part of
the regiments exhibited only the skeletons of
military array. In some, more officers than
privates were to be seen in the ranks; in all,
the appearance of the troops, the haggard air
of the men, their worn-out uniforms, and the
strange motley of which they were composed,
bespoke the total exhaustion of the Empire.
It was evident to all that Napoleon was expending
his last resources. Besides the veterans of
the Guard—the iron men whom nothing could
daunt, but whose tattered garments and soiled
accoutrements bespoke the dreadful fatigue to
which they had been subjected—were to be
seen young conscripts, but recently torn from the
embraces of maternal love, and whose wan
visages and faltering steps told but too clearly
that they were unequal to the weight of the arms
they bore. The gaunt figures and woeful aspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of the horses, the broken carriages and blackened
mouths of the guns, the crazy and fractured
artillery wagons which defiled past, the general
confusion of arms, battalions, and uniforms,
even in the best appointed corps, spoke of the
mere remains of the vast military army which
had so long stood triumphant against the world
in arms. The soldiers exhibited none of their
ancient enthusiasm as they defiled past the
Emperor; silent and sad they took their way
before him: the stern realities of war had chased
away its enthusiastic ardour. All felt that in
this dreadful contest they themselves would
perish, happy if they had not previously witnessed
the degradation of France!”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p>What is indeed the most interesting of all the
Eagles, the most famous battle-standard in the
world, which for a time was at the Invalides, is
at present preserved in private hands in Paris—the
Eagle of Napoleon’s Old Guard, the Eagle
of the “Adieu of Fontainebleau.” It is treasured
with devoted care in the family of the officer who
commanded the Grenadiers of the Guard in the
retreat from Moscow, at Fontainebleau, and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
Waterloo—General Petit. It is kept in the house,
in Paris, in which the old general died, in the
room he used as his <i lang="fr">salon</i>. General Petit refused
to be parted from the Eagle of his regiment
during his lifetime; he kept it with him wherever
he went, always in his personal care. It
was at the Invalides while General Petit was in
residence there as Governor of the Hospital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD GUARD AT FONTAINEBLEAU</div>

<p>On that never-to-be-forgotten April forenoon
of 1814, in the Court of the White Horse of the
Château of Fontainebleau, Napoleon embraced
the standard, and taking the Eagle in his hands,
kissed it in front of the veteran Grenadiers of
the Old Guard. His travelling carriage, to convey
the fallen Emperor on the first stage of his
journey to Elba, was in waiting, close by, ready
to start. Twelve hundred Grenadiers of the
Guard stood with presented arms all round the
courtyard; drawn up in a great hollow square
as a guard of honour to render to the master
they adored the parting salute.</p>

<p>Napoleon passed slowly round the square
and inspected the ranks, man by man, looking
intently into the scarred and war-worn, weather-beaten
old faces, each one of which was familiar
to him. Their station on every battlefield
had been close at hand to where he took up his
post. Night after night, in every campaign
from Austerlitz to those last dreadful weeks,
he had slept in their midst; his tent always
pitched in the centre of the camp of the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Guard. That had been Napoleon’s invariable
custom in war. They had shared with him that
last forlorn-hope march to save Paris, until,
completely worn out and footsore, exhausted
nature forbade their attempting to go farther.
With tears streaming from their eyes the old
soldiers, before whose bayonets in the charge
no Continental foe had ever stood, mutely returned
Napoleon’s last wistful, pathetic look of
farewell.</p>

<p>He addressed a few touching words to them,
standing in the centre of the square. Next he
turned to General Petit, near at hand, and
before them he took the general in his arms,
as representing all, and kissed him on the cheek.
“I cannot embrace you all,” exclaimed Napoleon
in a voice broken with emotion, yet which all
could hear distinctly, “so I embrace your
General!” Then he motioned to the Porte-Aigle,
standing all the while before him, with
the Eagle held in the attitude of salute.</p>

<p>“Bring me the Eagle,” he said, “that I may
embrace it also!” “Que m’apporte l’Aigle,
que je l’embrasse aussi!” were Napoleon’s
words.</p>

<p>The Porte-Aigle advanced and again inclined
the Eagle forward to the Emperor. Napoleon
took hold of it, embraced and kissed it three
times, tears in his eyes, and displaying the
deepest emotion.</p>

<p>“Ah, chère Aigle,” he exclaimed, “que les<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
baisers que je te donne retentissent dans la
postérité.”</p>

<p>The Eagle-bearer then stepped back a pace.</p>

<p>“Adieu, mes enfants! Adieu, mes braves!
Entourez moi encore une fois!” were Napoleon’s
closing words as the historic scene
terminated.</p>

<p>The old soldiers all stood utterly broken
down, weeping bitter tears, overcome with
grief, as Napoleon made his way to the carriage;
the members of the Household bowing
low as he passed, and kissing his hand, were all
also in tears.</p>

<p>Finally, amid a mournful cry of “Vive
l’Empereur!” Napoleon drove away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASHES MINGLED WITH WINE</div>

<p>As soon as Napoleon’s carriage was beyond
the precincts, the Grenadiers of the Guard
solemnly lowered the Imperial Standard, flying
above the Château. There, in the courtyard,
they burned it. Then, mixing the ashes
in a barrel of wine that was brought out, they
handed round the liquor in bowls and drank off
the draught, pledging Napoleon with cries of
“Vive l’Empereur!” So it is related by one
who was an eye-witness and a partaker; one
of the officers of the Old Guard.</p>

<p>Kept safely in concealment for ten months by
General Petit, during the Bourbon Restoration
period in 1814, the Eagle of the Old Guard
appeared once more after the return from Elba.
It faced the enemy for the last time at Waterloo.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Something of that will be said further on.
General Petit kept close beside it all through the
retreat, during that night of horror after Waterloo;
a faithful band of devoted veterans accompanying
him and surrounding the Eagle. So it
made its final return to France, to be preserved
for the rest of his life by the man who, above
all others, had most right to be custodian of
the Eagle of the Old Guard.</p>

<p>The Bourbon War Minister ordered it to be
given up, to be burned at the artillery dépôt
at Vincennes with the other Eagles that the
Restoration officials were able to get hold of.
General Petit flatly and indignantly refused
to part with the Eagle of the Old Guard. He
was able, as before, to conceal it successfully,
in spite of every effort to discover its whereabouts,
until after the Revolution of 1830.
Then, at the last, it was safe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLAG OF THE OLD GUARD</div>

<p>Faded and frayed away in parts, the gold
embroidery on it dulled and tarnished from the
lapse of years, and torn here and there round the
jagged bullet-holes in the silk, is now, in its old
age, the Flag of the Old Guard. As it was at
first—as it was when it made its débût at the
opening of its career, on that December afternoon
on the Field of Mars—the flag is of rich
crimson silk, fringed with gold, sprinkled over
on both sides with golden bees, and with, at the
corners, encircled in golden laurel-wreaths, the
Imperial cypher, the letter “N.” In shape<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
it was—and of course is still—almost a square:
a metre deep, vertically, on the staff, and some
half-dozen inches more than that lengthwise,
horizontally, in the fly. On one side, in the
centre, the Napoleonic Eagle is displayed, a
gold embroidered Eagle poised on a thunderbolt.
Inscribed round the Eagle in letters of
gold is the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
“GARDE IMPÉRIALE<br><br>

<span class="smcap">L’Empereur Napoléon</span><br>
<span class="smcap">au 1<sup>er</sup> Régiment des</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Grenadiers à Pied.</span>”
</p>

<p>On the other side are inscribed these fifteen
names of Napoleon’s great days in war, also
in golden letters: “Marengo; Ulm; Austerlitz;
Jéna; Berlin; Eylau; Friedland; Madrid;
Eckmühl; Essling; Wagram; Vienna; Smolensk;
Moskowa; Moscow.”</p>

<p>The two marshals charged with the defence
of Paris, Marmont and Mortier, had on that
afternoon placed the submission of the capital
in the hands of Alexander of Russia on the
heights of Montmartre, whence, and from the
Buttes Chaumont and the other northern heights
from right to left, 300 loaded cannon pointed
threateningly down over the vanquished and
panic-stricken city, supported by the bayonets
and sabres of 120,000 men, Russians and
Prussians, Bavarians, Würtemburgers, and Austrians,
flushed and exultant in their hour of
supreme triumph, the soldiers of all the nations
of the Continent at war with Napoleon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON WITHIN TWELVE MILES</div>

<p>It was at ten o’clock on that fateful night for
France that the great destruction of trophies at
the Invalides took place. Napoleon had set
his last stake, had attempted his desperate last
manœuvre, and had failed. He had been foiled
and baffled when within reach almost of his goal.
At that very hour indeed, only twelve miles
away, he had just been stopped in his wild
midnight gallop, his final forlorn-hope effort to
reach the capital, by the news that all hope was
past, that the worst had happened, that Paris
had fallen.</p>

<p>Only forty-eight hours before, on Monday night,
at Saint-Dizier, a small town 170 miles away,
had Napoleon suddenly realised the gravity
of the catastrophe impending over Paris. He
was at that moment in the act of dealing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Allies a counter-stroke which he confidently
believed would save the situation and bring the
enemy’s advance to a general stand. Just a
week before, he had abruptly turned back in
his retreat towards the capital and had boldly
started to march across the rear of the Allies
in the direction of the Rhine. He would sever
their communications; he would cut the enemy
off from their base. Calling out the <i lang="fr">levée en
masse</i> of the peasantry all over Eastern France,
and at the same time rallying to him the garrisons
of the French fortresses in Alsace and
Lorraine, with 100,000 men at his disposal,
led by Ney, Macdonald, Victor, and Oudinot,
while two other marshals, Marmont and Mortier,
held the enemy at bay in front of Paris, he was
looking forward to checkmate the Allies at the
last moment and paralyse their advance on the
capital. It was a daring and masterly project;
but the Fortune of War was against Napoleon.
He had sent word of his plans to Marie Louise
at the Tuileries, together with instructions to his
brother Joseph, Governor of Paris, but on the
way a Cossack patrol captured the bearer of the
vitally important documents. Napoleon’s despatch
for once was not in cypher, and its full
import was apparent instantly. It was carried
to the Czar Alexander, and forthwith laid before
a hastily convened Russian council of war.
Another letter, taken at the same time, laid
bare the critical condition of affairs inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Paris itself; describing how all was in confusion
there, and that treachery to the cause
of the Empire was at work within the city. The
council of war decided to pay no heed to Napoleon’s
counter-stroke, and, instead, to march
at once on Paris in full force. Marmont and
Mortier, it was known, could barely muster
6,000 regulars. With Blücher’s Prussians, at
that moment on the point of joining them, the
Allies could bring into line not far short of
150,000 men. This final plan was agreed to
on the afternoon of Friday, March 24, and the
general advance began at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON’S BLANK DISMAY</div>

<p>Napoleon knew nothing of what was happening
until late on the night of the 27th, the following
Monday. Then he was suddenly made aware
of the full position. “Nothing,” exclaimed the
doomed Emperor in blank dismay, “but a
thunderbolt can save us now.” The Allies
then had not turned back! The enemy nearest
him, whom he had planned to attack next day,
believing them to be the Russian main army,
was only—he discovered at the last moment—a
cavalry division, sent back to delude him and
prevent his finding out what was really going
on. And the troops advancing on Paris were
already three clear days ahead of him! Napoleon
counter-marched his whole force at once to
hasten to the rescue of the capital. They would
take the route by Sens, Troyes, and Fontainebleau,
making a sweep to keep clear of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
enemy’s columns, and approach Paris by the
south bank of the Seine. It was a long march
of fully 180 miles, but there was no other
way open. Marmont and Mortier, to whom
the news of Napoleon’s intended approach was
sent off immediately, must manage to hold out
in front of the city on the north bank until the
Emperor arrived.</p>

<p>Fresh news, however, and yet more serious,
as to the imminence of the grave peril threatening
Paris, reached Napoleon during Tuesday night.
Leaving the army to follow, he pressed forward
ahead of the troops by himself in his travelling-carriage,
escorted only by the Old Guard. They
hurried forward with feverish eagerness all that
night and the next day, the men of the Guard
panting along at the double in their effort to
keep up. With hardly a halt, they struggled
along, famishing—most of the men had tasted
no cooked food for the past five days—shoeless
most of them, plodding and splashing barefoot
through the mud, ankle deep; under a pitiless
downpour of rain all the time. By Wednesday
evening, the 30th, they had reached Troyes, after
a forty miles march without a stop. There,
still worse news reached Napoleon. Marmont
and Mortier had been disastrously defeated at
Meaux, and in consequence their defence of the
northern heights outside the city was all but
hopeless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT FULL GALLOP FOR PARIS</div>

<p>Napoleon, on that, abandoned his travelling-carriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
for a light post-chaise, which set off at
a gallop. He must now risk a ride practically
unattended, in the desperate hope of being
able to evade hostile patrols and get by stealth
into the city. Once there, he would himself
take charge of the defence. The men of the
Old Guard were left behind at Troyes. They
were worn out and unable, from sheer exhaustion,
to go a step farther. Only a troop of Cuirassiers
rode with the post-chaise, and most of these
had to give up and drop back as the chaise raced
forward, Napoleon himself from time to time
calling from the windows to the postillions to
keep on flogging the horses and go faster and
faster. At every stopping-place to change horses
the Emperor sent off a courier to tell Paris to
hold out; and at each post-house he received
still more alarming messages from the city. Now
he heard that the Empress and his little son had
had to fly from Paris. Then he learned that the
whole city was in a state of complete panic, with
affrighted peasants from all round crowding in;
the shops and banks all shut; the theatres closed,
a thing that had not happened even at the
height of the Reign of Terror; everywhere chaos
and hopeless despair. After that came the news
that the enemy were advancing so fast that
they were expected at any moment before the
City barriers.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock Napoleon arrived at the village
of Fromenteau, near the Fountains of Juvisy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
twelve and a half miles from Paris. The post-chaise
had to stop there again for a relay of
fresh horses. As it drew up, a party of soldiers
passed by, coming from the direction of the
capital. Not knowing who was in the chaise,
some of them shouted out to the occupants,
Napoleon, and Caulaincourt, who had been riding
with the Emperor: “Paris has surrendered!”</p>

<p>The dread news struck Napoleon like a bullet
between the eyes. “It is impossible! The
men are mad!” he hissed out, gripping at the
cushions of his seat. Then he turned to his
companion: “Find an officer and bring him
to me!”</p>

<p>One rode up, as it happened, at that moment,
a General Belliard. Napoleon questioned him
eagerly, and he gave the Emperor sufficient
details to leave no doubt of what had befallen.
Great drops of sweat stood on Napoleon’s forehead.
He turned, quivering with excitement,
to Caulaincourt. “Do you hear that?” he
ejaculated hoarsely, fixing a gaze on his companion
under the light of the lamps, the bare
memory of which made Caulaincourt shudder
ever after to his dying day.</p>

<p>They left the chaise, and looking across the
Seine Napoleon saw to the north and east, in
the direction of Villeneuve Saint-Georges, the glare
of the enemy’s watch-fires. Marshal Berthier
now came up in a second post-chaise which had
been following the Emperor’s. Speaking excitedly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Napoleon declared that he would go
on to Paris. He set off walking rapidly along
the road in the dark, leaving the horses to be
put to and the post-chaise to pick him up.
Berthier and Caulaincourt attended him, and
General Belliard and some dragoons followed
at a few paces behind. Napoleon rejected
every remonstrance and refused to turn back.
“I asked them,” exclaimed Napoleon, talking
half to himself, half to his companions, “to hold
out for only twenty-four hours! Miserable
wretches! Marmont swore that he would be
cut to pieces rather than yield! And Joseph
ran away: my own brother! To surrender the
capital to the enemy: what poltroons!” So
he went on in a breathless torrent of words.
He added finally: “They have capitulated:
betrayed their country; betrayed their Emperor;
degraded France! It is too terrible!
Every one has lost his head! When I am not
there they do nothing but add blunder to
blunder.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MISERABLE WRETCHES!”</div>

<p>But to go on, with Paris in the hands of an
army of 150,000 men, was out of the question.
Napoleon had to bow to the inevitable. He
at length yielded to the protests of the others.
He stopped beside the Fountains of Juvisy.
“He sat down on the parapet of one of the
fountains,” described Labédoyère, an eye-witness,
“and remained above a quarter of an hour
with his head resting on his hands, lost in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
most painful reflections.” Then he rose, went
back to the post-chaise, and, telling General
Belliard to rally all the men he could at Essonne,
set off to drive to Fontainebleau. He reached
there at six next morning.</p>

<p>Between ten o’clock on Wednesday night and
six o’clock on Thursday morning the tragedy
at the Invalides was enacted. Its opening scene
took place just as Napoleon’s post-chaise was
drawing up in the village of Fromenteau. Its
final scene took place just as the post-chaise was
entering the courtyard of Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>The Capitulation of Paris was signed before
the Barrier of La Villette at five in the afternoon.
Its first article laid down that the French army
must evacuate Paris within twelve hours: before
five o’clock next morning. The last clause recommended
the city to the mercy of the Allied
Sovereigns, and of the Czar Alexander in particular.</p>

<p>All day long the booming of cannon and rattle
of musketry had dinned in the ears of the
trembling and terrified Parisians, ever steadily
drawing nearer. The marshals, Marmont and
Mortier, had made their last stand, and, resisting
desperately to the last, in a struggle in which
the Allies lost two to every one of the defenders,
so ferocious was the contest, had been beaten
back into the city. They carried back with
them, so gallantly had they counter-attacked
at one point, the standard of the Second Squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of the Russian Garde du Corps—now a
trophy in the present collection at the Invalides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEYOND ALL HOPE NOW</div>

<p>The outnumbered and exhausted troops could
make no further fight, although, to the end,
many of the soldiers were for holding out to the
last cartridge. The <i lang="fr">Générale</i> had beaten to arms
at two in the morning; at six, with sunrise, the
enemy’s guns opened fire; from then until late
in the afternoon the fighting had gone on incessantly.</p>

<p>All was over by four o’clock. From east to
west, from Charenton and Belleville, right round
to Neuilly, the Allies, the Russians, Blücher’s
Prussians, and the Austrians, had captured
every position capable of defence, one after the
other, by sheer weight of numbers, and had
carried at the point of the bayonet every place
of vantage held by the French. Woronzeff and
the Prince of Würtemburg had stormed Romainville,
La Villette, and La Chapelle. Langeron
and the Russian Imperial Guard were masters
of the heights of Montmartre and the Buttes
Chaumont, looking down directly on Paris.
Eighty-six guns had been taken from the
marshals since the morning; nearly six thousand
soldiers and National Guards had fallen, killed
or wounded, facing the foe. A six-miles long
line of batteries and battalions on the side of the
Allies had closed in to within short musket
range of the Paris barriers. Already the Russian
cannon were opening fire on the city, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
their shells were bursting over the central streets
of Paris; falling, some in the Chaussée d’Antin
and on the Boulevard des Italiens.</p>

<p>At four o’clock Marmont, who had been the
soul of the defence, fighting, now on horseback,
now on foot, using his sword at times—“the
marshal was seen everywhere in the thickest of
the fight, a dozen or more soldiers were bayoneted
at his side, and his hat was riddled with bullets”—at
four o’clock Marmont repassed within the
barriers to announce that further defence was
impossible. He was scarcely recognisable, we
are told—“he had a beard of eight days’ growth;
the great-coat which covered his uniform was in
tatters; from head to foot he was blackened with
powder-smoke.” Then had to be done the only
thing that was left to do. Marmont and Mortier
held a hasty conference, and after it a trumpeter
and an aide de camp carrying a white flag rode
out through the firing line to the nearest advanced
post of the Allies. The officer was taken before
the Czar Alexander on the plateau of Chaumont,
and Paris surrendered. The last sounds that
were heard on the French side as the firing
ceased came from a battalion of the Imperial
Guard which had been serving under Marmont,
from a scanty remnant of veterans stubbornly
resisting at bay to the last—shouts of “Vive
l’Empereur!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FLAG OF THE POLYTECHNIC</div>

<p>The old pensioners of the Invalides manfully
did their duty, and bore their part in the defence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
all day, as well as they were able. All who
could carry a musket had gone out to the barriers;
others did their best by helping to bring
up ammunition. Most of them fought at the
Barrière du Trône on the Vincennes road, assisting
the brave lads of the Polytechnic School to
hold the post and man a battery of eight-and-twenty
cannon in front of the barrier; until a
headlong charge of Russian cavalry, Pahlen’s
dragoons with some Cossacks, swooped down
from the flank, annihilating the devoted band of
gunners. Those of the boys who were left,
however, saved the school flag, presented to the
Polytechnic just ten years before by the Emperor
with his own hand, on the Day of the
Eagles on the Field of Mars. With the Invalides’
veterans and some of the National
Guards, the survivors held the barrier throughout
the day to the end, beating back repeated
attempts of the Russians to storm the gate.
The lads, finally, after learning that Marmont
had capitulated, made their way back to the
school, and there burned their precious standard
to save it from falling into the enemy’s hands.
Those who were left of the veterans hastened
back to the Invalides at the same time, overcome
with anxiety to learn what was to happen
to their own priceless treasures within the
Hospital, the trophy flags. There were at the
Invalides at that time, by one account, 1417
trophy flags; according to another account—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
included apparently in the total the
returned Battalion and Light Infantry and
Cavalry Eagles—altogether 1,800 standards.</p>

<p>Within the walls of the Invalides all was deep
gloom and hopeless despondency among those
in charge. Even at nightfall, as it would appear,
the authorities had not made up their minds
how the trophies were to be disposed of.</p>

<p>It is a hapless and pitiful story from first to
last. Some time previously, while the Allied
armies were still being kept at bay on the plains
of Champagne, the Governor of the Invalides, old
Marshal Serrurier, a distinguished veteran of
the Revolutionary Army, had applied to the
Minister of War for instructions as to the disposal
of the trophies at the Invalides in the event of the
enemy advancing on Paris. The only answer he
received was a formal letter to the effect that the
matter would have to go before the Emperor. At
that time Napoleon was in the midst of his last
forlorn-hope attempt to stem the tide of invasion;
in the midst of a life-and-death struggle, fighting
desperately day after day at one place or another.
The Ministry of War apparently pigeon-holed
the application after that, and forgot all about
the trophies at the Invalides until the actual day
of the attack on Paris—until that Wednesday
forenoon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORGOTTEN UNTIL TOO LATE</div>

<p>Then, when already Marmont’s outer line of
defence had been forced, and the last fight for
the inner heights overlooking the city was raging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
furiously, almost within sight from the Invalides,
a letter from the War Minister was
handed to Serrurier. It “trusted that the
Marshal had taken steps for the safety of the
trophies; especially for the preservation of
Frederick the Great’s sword. The flags,” continued
the letter, “had best be detached from
their staves, and rolled up carefully. The War
Minister is sure that your Excellency will do all
that is possible. The road to the Loire is open.”
Such were the instructions sent to the Invalides
after the eleventh hour! Then, during the
afternoon, when the enemy’s bombshells, fired
from the plateau of Chaumont, were falling in the
heart of the city, a single artillery wagon, or
fourgon, a vehicle barely large enough to remove
a small percentage of what there was to carry
away, drew up at the main gates of the Invalides.
It brought also ten more trophy flags, collected
from somewhere in Paris. In the general confusion
nobody, it would seem, even inquired
what they were or where they came from. The
driver’s instructions were merely that “they
were to go away with the Invalides trophies.”
The ten flags were taken out and stacked in a
corridor for the time being, while the fourgon
waited unheeded at the gate until after dark.</p>

<p>What steps Marshal Serrurier took during the
afternoon to secure adequate transport is unknown;
or, indeed, what he did with himself all
that time. The Governor was seen just before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
the dinner-hour in the Corridor d’Avignon, in
an out-of-the-way part of the building, in conference
with the Lieutenant-Governor and an
adjutant-major. Another officer, Adjutant Vollerand,
was with them, holding in his hands
Frederick the Great’s sword and sash. Apparently
they did not want to be observed, and
were discussing how to hide the relics or bury
them within the precincts of the Invalides.
After that nothing more was seen of Serrurier
at the Invalides until between nine and ten at
night, some hours after the Capitulation, and
when it had become known that the Allies intended
to occupy Paris in force, and that their
troops would enter and take possession of the
city early next morning. Then the Governor
reappeared.</p>

<p>A few minutes after nine o’clock the veterans
of the Invalides, who had been restlessly pacing
about the halls and corridors during the evening,
or standing about in dejected groups in the courtyards,
not knowing what they were to do, were
suddenly summoned to muster at once in the
Grand Court, or Cour d’Honneur. All turned out
from the wards and paraded, forming up by
the light of lanterns. All but those who were
bedridden were brought out, the maimed and
cripples being led out, or hobbling out on their
crutches, together with the survivors of those
who had fought so gallantly at the barriers
during the day, their faces still begrimed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
powder-smoke, their clothes torn and stained,
some without their hats, their arms in slings, or
with bandages over recent wounds. Then the
tall, spare figure of the Governor, a grim, hard-featured
old warrior, white-haired, over seventy
years of age, was seen emerging from his quarters,
with the senior staff-officers of the Hospital
following in rear. Serrurier harangued the
pensioners briefly. He told them that the
enemy would enter the city next day and would
present themselves at the Invalides to enforce
the giving up of the trophies. What did the
men of the Invalides desire should be done?</p>

<div class="sidenote">“LET US BURN THEM HERE!”</div>

<p>There was a pause for a moment; a dead
silence, as the old soldiers gazed dumbfoundedly
at one another. Then one man stepped out to
the front and spoke up for the rest. A battle-scarred
old sergeant-pensioner of the Grenadiers
of the Old Guard answered the Governor
on behalf of his comrades, his reply, greeted as
it was by vociferous shouts of approval on
every side, voicing the unanimous wish of the
veterans. “If they will not let us keep our
banners, let us burn them here! We will
swallow the ashes!” The order to make a
bonfire of the trophies then and there was issued
forthwith.</p>

<p>Anything that came to hand for fuel was
eagerly seized, and a great pile speedily made of
broken-up stools and mess-tables and forms,
hauled out from the barrack-rooms withindoors.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
They were stacked in a heap just in front of
the pedestal on which it had been intended
to erect an equestrian statue of the heroic
Marshal Lannes, who died from his wounds at
Aspern in the arms of Napoleon. Meanwhile,
parties of men ran inside with ladders, and set
to work to strip the dining-halls and the Chapel
of the rows of flags hanging up there. They bore
them outside, roughly bundled together in their
arms; some, silently, with frowning, stern-set
faces and set teeth; others beside themselves
with rage, and cursing savagely aloud; others
sullenly muttering oaths; not a few of the old
fellows with tears streaming down their cheeks.
They carried the trophies out and heaped them
up into an immense funeral pyre. The battalion
and other Eagles shared the fate of the captured
trophies—standards, some of these, that had
been borne under fire in the thick of triumphant
battle at Austerlitz, and Jena, at Auerstadt
and Friedland—to save them on the morrow
from falling into the hands of those in whose
defeat and humiliation they had had their part.
The fire was lighted and the masses of tattered
silk blazed up furiously. When the flames
were at their fiercest, Marshal Serrurier stepped
forward and with his own hand flung into the
midst of the fiery mass the sword of Frederick
the Great.</p>

<p>For half the night the veterans stood round and
watched the flames complete the work of destruction.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
They stood massed round in a densely
packed throng of sullen, gloomy, brokenhearted
men. They stayed there until long after midnight,
gazing, in a state of dull despair, at the
fire; while some now and again stirred up the
glowing fuel and made the flames leap up afresh,
roaring and crackling and casting a dull red
throbbing glare over the old walls and rows of
windows all round, and gleaming on the lofty
gilded dome of the Invalides, in itself an intended
memento of victory. On first seeing the golden
domes of the Kremlin as he approached Moscow,
Napoleon had sent orders to Paris to have the
dome of the Invalides gilded as a memorial of
his achievement of the goal of the campaign!
Most of the veterans stood there throughout
the greater part of that cold March night,
watching until the fire had died down and only
a great heap of smouldering cinders remained;
all that was left of the trophies of victorious
France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TROPHIES OF TWO CENTURIES</div>

<p>Among the vast array of foreign trophies at
the Invalides that perished on that night were
English flags nearly two centuries old, the remains
of the spoil of some forty-four English
banners of Charles the First’s soldiers, triumphantly
carried to Paris from the Ile de Rhé
in November 1627 and hung in Notre Dame.
Others flags destroyed there, too, dated from the
wars of the Grand Monarque; spoils won on
the battlefield by the famous Condé and Turenne;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
also trophies taken from William the Third at
Steenkirk and Landen and elsewhere; the
British and Dutch and Danish and Bavarian
ensigns won by Turenne’s great successor,
Marshal Luxembourg, “le Tapissier de Notre
Dame,” as they dubbed him at Versailles, for
the almost innumerable trophies sent by Luxembourg
to be hung up in the Cathedral of Paris,
with State processions and Te Deums in the
presence of the King. Other British battle-spoils,
the trophies of France, which passed out
of existence at the Invalides on that night were
these: a flag taken at Fontenoy by the Irish
Brigade; the regimental colours surrendered
by the garrison of Minorca which Admiral
Byng failed to rescue; those of another British
garrison of Minorca of the time of the Great
Siege of Gibraltar, when France, for the second
time, wrested the island from England; four
British and Hessian regimental flags surrendered
to Washington at Yorktown and sent
by Congress as a gift to the King of France;
flags taken by the French from British West
India garrisons in the same war; besides British
naval ensigns also taken during the American
War, with other British ship-flags, some of which
indeed dated from the earlier battle times of
Duguay Trouin and Jean Bart. Destroyed at
the Invalides also on that Wednesday night
was a British naval ensign from Trafalgar. It
had been hoisted on board one of Nelson’s prizes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
the <i lang="fr">Algéciras</i>. In the storm after the battle
the ship was in imminent peril of wreck, and the
French prisoners on board were liberated in
order to help to save her. They used their
freedom to overpower the small British prize-crew
and carried the vessel off into Cadiz, whence
the British ensign, hoisted originally in triumph
over the French tricolor during the battle of
two days before, on the <i lang="fr">Algéciras</i> being captured,
was sent as a trophy to Paris. There were
also destroyed at the Invalides at the same
time the ensign of Lord Cochrane’s famous
brig-of-war, the <i>Speedy</i>, captured in the Mediterranean
in 1801, and those of three British line-of-battle
ships, the <i>Berwick</i>, the <i>Swiftsure</i>, and
the <i>Hannibal</i>, taken within the previous twenty
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPOILS TAKEN IN NAVAL FIGHTS</div>

<p>Most of the trophies won by Napoleon and the
Grand Army all over Europe, and by the Armies
of the Republic and Consulate before that,
perished in the holocaust: the spoils of Valmy
and Fleurus and Jemmapes; of Hohenlinden;
of Dego and Mondovi; of Rivoli and Montenotte;
of Castiglione, Lodi, and Arcola; of
Zurich and Marengo, and other victories. On
that night, too, passed out of existence the
famous flag of the Army of Italy presented by
Napoleon, and bearing inscribed on it the names
of eighty triumphs on the battlefield and the
detailed record of the taking of 150,000 prisoners,
170 standards, 550 siege-guns, and 600 pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
of field artillery; the Horse-tail banners of the
Mamelukes, taken by Napoleon at the battle
of the Pyramids; the historic standard of the
Knights of St. John, won in hand-to-hand fight
outside the main gate of Valetta. Most of
the 340 Prussian standards Napoleon sent to
Paris after the Jena campaign, together with
the sword and Black Eagle sash of Frederick
the Great, as well as the recovered French
trophies of the Seven Years’ War, originally
won by Frederick at Rosbach, the standards
of Frederick the Great’s Guards, and Austrian
spoils taken by the Prussians at Leuthen, Kolin,
and Hohenfriedburg, all of which had been
carried off to Paris by Napoleon—these were
among the war-treasures destroyed at the Invalides
on that night. With them went into
the flames the Grand Army’s Russian trophies
from Eylau and Friedland, the Austrian trophies
from Eckmühl and Wagram, besides many
Spanish and Portuguese trophies taken before
Wellington landed in the Peninsula to turn the
tide of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AFTER DUPONT’S SURRENDER</div>

<p>One French Eagle which perished on that
night was the survivor of a disaster: Dupont’s
surrender at Bailen in Andalusia in 1808,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
the outset of the Spanish insurrection; that
cruel humiliation for the arms of France, the news
of which came on Europe with all the startling
effect of a thunderclap, and drove Napoleon
nearly frantic in his furious indignation. It had
been one of three Eagles taken by the Spaniards,
that of the 24me Légère, and had been recovered
by the daring of an officer of the regiment, one
of the prisoners, Captain Lanusse. Confined in a
prison-hulk at Cadiz, he escaped to shore one
night, managed to find out where his regiment’s
flag was kept, displayed as a Spanish trophy, got
hold of it, and then made his way outside the city
into the lines of the besieging French army.
There he presented the Eagle to Marshal Soult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
who forwarded it direct to Napoleon. Lanusse,
as his reward, was promoted a <i lang="fr">chef de bataillon</i>
of the 8th of the Line, and fell to the bayonet of
a British soldier of the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers
at Barrosa. The recovered Eagle Napoleon
sent to the Invalides.</p>

<p>By morning all that remained of the proud
trophies of France at the Invalides was a heap
of grey ashes, fragments of charred flag-poles,
and scraps of partly molten metal. The <i lang="fr">débris</i>
was raked up at daylight, and shovelled into the
artillery fourgon of the previous afternoon,
which had been standing all night outside the
main gate of the Invalides. The artillery wagon
drove off with it to the Seine near by and emptied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
the heap into the river. That was the end of
the night’s destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ALL THAT WAS DREDGED UP</div>

<p>Some portion of the <i lang="fr">débris</i> was recovered from
the Seine a year afterwards, and is preserved in
the Chapel of the Invalides now. In June
1815 a workman, doing some repairs by the
riverside, discovered a portion of a flag under
water, and on hearing of that, two patriotic
young Frenchmen, an engineer and a journalist,
privately set to work soon afterwards to see
if they could fish up anything that might be
worth preserving. At the time the Allies were in
possession of Paris, during the second occupation,
after Waterloo, and the two young men
had to proceed cautiously. They were successful
in the end in recovering portions of 183 trophies,
metal spear-head ornaments, from ensign-staves
mostly. Seventy-eight were later identified as
of Austrian origin; one as part of a British flag;
two as having belonged to Russian standards;
various fragments as the remains of thirty-nine
Prussian standards; four from Spanish flags
with Bourbon fleurs-de-lis; and two fragments
of Turkish standards from Egypt. The
remainder of the salvage it was impossible to
identify.</p>

<p>That the great sacrifice had not been made in
vain, was speedily apparent. In the course of
the morning after the bonfire, a little before noon
on Thursday, March 31, within two hours of the
entry into Paris of the vanguard of the Allied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
armies, a Russian aide de camp presented himself
at the Invalides, and, in the name of the
Allied sovereigns, demanded a statement of the
trophies kept there. The officer came up on
horseback, accompanied by a mounted man of
the National Guard, and an armed escort of
Russian dragoons. The main gate was open as
usual, and the Russian officer rode through without
taking notice of the gate-sentry’s challenge.
He was only stopped by a rush of the pensioners’
day-guard, called out by the sentry’s shout of
alarm—“Aux armes!” The guard turned out
and faced the aide de camp with lowered halberds.
The Russian colonel protested, but the
officer on duty refused to let him pass without
orders from his own chief, and General Darnaud,
the Lieutenant-Governor, was sent for. That
officer came, and the Russian dismounted and
explained his mission. He had orders, he said,
to “take cognisance” of the trophies of the
Invalides. General Darnaud replied bluntly:
“Very good, I will permit you to visit the Hôtel.
Come with me!” The general added: “As to
the trophies, sir, we have dealt with them according
to the laws of war!” “On en avait agi
suivant les lois de guerre!” were his words. The
Russian did not seem to grasp the general’s
meaning, and stood still for a moment, staring
blankly at him. On that, Madame Darnaud, the
Lieutenant-Governor’s wife, who had followed
into the courtyard immediately after her husband,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
interposed. She addressed the officer,
speaking volubly and angrily, but only to draw
down on herself from the Russian the uncivil
rejoinder that he had not come there to talk to
a woman! After that, the general, accompanied
by some of the men of the main guard
with shouldered halberds, formally conducted
the officer inside the Invalides, the party taking
their way along the colonnade round the Court
of Honour, in the midst of which could be seen
the wide burnt-out space where the fire had been,
the pungent smell of the fumes from which
still hung about the place, and so into the Chapel
of St. Louis. There the scene that met the
Russian aide de camp’s eyes seemed to stagger
him: bare blank walls, the gallery stripped and
defaced; with empty and broken metal sockets
here and there to show where the flags had been
fastened up. The interior had been entirely
cleared from end to end along the sides. It was
absolutely unrecognisable to any who had seen
it before. The Russian officer, who had visited
the Invalides six or seven years previously, after
Tilsit, could only gaze round dumbly, utterly
taken aback. He muttered something, but did
not speak aloud. Then, glaring round savagely
into the eyes of those about him, he turned away
abruptly, and was conducted to the Outer Court,
where he remounted his horse, and rode off
hastily in the direction whence he had come.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WALLS STRIPPED AND BARE</div>

<p>All Napoleon’s trophies, however, did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
perish at the Invalides. Some of the Grand
Army’s captured flags, as it so chanced, escaped
destruction on that night, and are at the Invalides
now. They are in the Chapel and in the Salle
Turenne, besides half a hundred in the Crypt,
grouped round Napoleon’s tomb. The forty-five
Austrian flags taken at Ulm are beside Napoleon’s
tomb, with nine other flags. Presented
by the Emperor to the Senate, as has been told,
the Ulm trophies, during the night of March 30,
were hastily taken down from where they had
been hung in the Grand Salon for the past nine
years, and hidden in a vault below. They made
a second public appearance on the occasion of
Napoleon’s funeral at the Invalides in 1840, when
they were placed at the head of the coffin. They
have ever since been kept beside the tomb.</p>

<p>The Austerlitz trophies met another fate.
Kept at Notre Dame, they disappeared mysteriously
from there in the early morning of the
day of the entry of the Allies into Paris. At
three in the morning of March 31 an urgent message
from the Prefect of the Seine was delivered
at Notre Dame, calling on the Cathedral authorities
to take down and conceal the Austerlitz
trophies at once. The Chapter met hastily in
the Archbishop’s room, and the flags were all
down within half an hour. They have never
been seen since, nor was their fate ever accounted
for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW FIFTY-ONE FLAGS WERE SAVED</div>

<p>At the Luxembourg Palace were displayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
110 trophies, the spoils of the Eagles, won from
all the nations of Europe and presented to
the <i lang="fr">Corps Legislatif</i> by Napoleon. They were
safely removed on the night of March 30, and
were hidden securely. Brought out and set up
again a year later, on Napoleon’s return from
Elba, the authorities forgot about hiding them
again in the confusion after Waterloo. As the
result more than half of them are now in Berlin.
Blücher sent a party of staff officers to seize the
entire collection, but a sharp-witted functionary
hoodwinked the Prussians on their arrival.
They went back to get written orders, and before
they returned, as many as possible of the trophies
had been pulled down and got out of the way.
One of the attendants managed the affair on
his own initiative, a hall-porter named Mathieu.
He was able to save and hide as many as fifty-one
of the flags, and they have since been forwarded
to the Invalides. The other fifty-nine trophies
the Prussians seized and carried off. Two
Austrian standards taken by Napoleon at
Marengo escaped destruction by having been
previously lent from the Invalides to an artist,
Charles Vernet, for a battle-picture he had been
commissioned to paint for Napoleon. They
were in Vernet’s studio in March 1814. His
son, Horace Vernet, returned them in later days
to the Invalides, where they now are.</p>

<p>In addition, it would seem, at least a moiety
of the Invalides trophies were kept back at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
last moment by some of the veterans themselves.
Several of the old soldiers, it would
appear, after stripping down the flags from the
walls, instead of carrying all out into the courtyard
to the bonfire, retained and hid a few of
them on their own account, to smuggle them
outside afterwards and keep them in concealment.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE EAGLES OF THE LAST ARMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Eagles came back to France with the
return of Napoleon from Elba; to lead the last
Army to the campaign of the Hundred Days.</p>

<p>They “flew from steeple to steeple across
France,” in Napoleon’s expressive phrase,
“from the shores of Fréjus until they alighted
on the towers of Notre Dame.” The enthusiasm
that greeted their reappearance spread like
wild-fire; it blazed up like an exploding magazine.
The rapturous acclamation and enthusiasm
with which the Eagles were welcomed
back was the measure of the prevailing
discontent and resentment among the soldiers
at the harsh and unworthy treatment they had
received during the ten months of the restored
<i lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>The Army had come off badly by its change
of masters. The Bourbons had done all in their
power to alienate its regard; as much through
malice in not a few cases, as through downright
stupidity.</p>

<p>“Of all the institutions of France the most
thoroughly national and the most thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
democratic was the Army; it was accordingly
against the Army that the <i lang="fr">noblesse</i> directed its
first efforts. Financial difficulties made a large
reduction in the forces necessary. Fourteen
thousand officers and sergeants were accordingly
dismissed on half-pay; but no sooner had this
measure of economy been effected than a multitude
of emigrants who had served against the
Republic in the army of the Prince of Condé or
in La Vendée were rewarded with all degrees
of military rank.... The tricolor, under which
every battle of France had been fought from
Jemmapes to Montmartre, was superseded by
the white flag of the House of Bourbon, under
which no living soldier had marched to victory....
The Imperial Guard was removed from
service at the Palace, and the so-called Military
Household of the old Bourbon monarchy revived,
with the privileges and the insignia
belonging to the period before 1775.”</p>

<p>The abolition of the Eagles was the preliminary
step of all. A justifiable measure, no
doubt, from a political point of view, it touched
to the quick the military instinct of the nation.
And on that followed the abolition of the national
tricolor in favour of the old Bourbon white flag.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EVERY ONE TO BE DESTROYED</div>

<p>Within three weeks of the Farewell of Fontainebleau
the Eagles of the Army, with the
tricolor standards, were officially proscribed;
the order went forth to send them to Paris
forthwith for destruction in the furnaces of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
artillery dépôt at Vincennes. On May 12 it
was notified that the white Bourbon flag was
again to be the standard of the Army, with a
brass fleur-de-lis at the head of the colour-staff
in place of the Eagle.</p>

<p>Every regiment was required to send its Eagle
to the Ministry of War in Paris on receipt of the
order. No allowances or exceptions were made;
although in several instances officers urgently
petitioned to be allowed to retain their Eagles
with the corps, if only as mementoes of feats of
arms achieved by the regiments in battle.
Every request was rejected, whatever the circumstances.
There were reasons of State policy
no doubt, as has been said, against the general
retention as regimental standards of military
insignia so intimately associated with Napoleon;
but in certain instances, at least, indulgence
might reasonably have been extended to the
applications. There were personal and romantic
associations connected with some of
the Eagles, specially endearing them to the
soldiers, for which privilege might well have been
accorded. One very hard case may be cited
as typical of others: that of the Eagle of the
25th of the Line.</p>

<p>The Eagle of the 25th had been carried under
fire in some twenty battles and all through the
Moscow campaign; and had notable battle-scars
to show for its distinguished services. One
leg and one wing of the Eagle had been shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
away in action, and there were five bullet-holes
in its metal body. Its maimed appearance,
indeed, had attracted Napoleon’s attention at
a review, and he had stopped while riding
past the regiment and taken the Eagle into his
hands, examining it with extreme interest and
putting his fingers into the bullet-holes, finally
returning it to the Porte-Aigle with a deep bow
of respect. The regiment almost worshipped
their Eagle on its own account, for what it had
gone through; but it had further undergone
yet more surprising adventures. The 25th had
been in the garrison of Dresden in 1813 when
Marshal St. Cyr had to capitulate to the Austrians.
On the night before the surrender the
Eagle-staff was broken up and burned, and the
few strips of ragged silk that remained of the
shot-torn regimental tricolor flag were tied
under an officer’s uniform for secret conveyance
out of the city. The shattered Eagle broke in
two while being removed from its staff, and its
two fragments were concealed under the petticoats
of two vivandières who were to convey it
in that manner to the regimental dépôt in France.
Under the capitulation the garrison was granted
the honours of war and a safe-conduct back to
France. The terms, however, were annulled
by the Allied Sovereigns then advancing, after
Leipsic, to invade France, and in the outcome all
the regiments, after they had started for France,
were made prisoners and marched away to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
interned in Hungary. The major of the 25th
got back the two fragments of the Eagle, stowed
them away under his uniform, and kept them
about him by day and night for five months;
until finally, on his release after Napoleon’s
abdication, he brought the Eagle back across
the Rhine, “wrapped up like contraband.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SEND IT TO PARIS FORTHWITH!”</div>

<p>On the 25th receiving the order to send in its
Eagle for destruction, he wrote personally to
the Minister of War—General Dupont, of Bailen
notoriety, as has been said—who had never
forgiven Napoleon’s harsh usage of him, and now
took every opportunity of paying back old scores
on the heads of his former comrades in arms.
The major wrote setting forth in detail the story
of the regimental Eagle, relating its exceptionally
interesting career and its battle damages,
also how he had preserved it after Dresden, and
implored the War Minister, in the name of the
regiment, that they might retain the two fragments
to be kept in the regimental “Salle
d’Honneur” as an honoured relic. The reply
was a peremptorily worded command to send
the Eagle to Paris forthwith for destruction
with the other Eagles of the Army. The major,
in the circumstances, considered himself compelled
to comply. He summoned the officers to
his quarters, where they “paid their last adieux
to the object of veneration, and then, in their
presence, the Eagle fragments were packed in a
box, and despatched to the Ministry of War.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span></p>

<p>The story, with others to the same effect, went
the round of every barrack-room in France, and
wherever it was told, there were angry murmurings
and increased discontent.</p>

<p>By no means all the Eagles of the Army, it
would appear, were given up to the authorities
in Paris. Not a few colonels flatly refused to
comply with Dupont’s order, taking the risk
of prosecution or of being turned out of the
service summarily—a certainty in any event
under the new <i lang="fr">régime</i>, as the majority of the
senior regimental officers anticipated, and as
actually came to pass. General Petit of the
Grenadiers of the Old Guard, as has already been
said, refused to give up that famous Eagle, and
concealed it successfully; and not a few other
officers did the same with the Eagles of their
corps. Others destroyed their regimental Eagles
and either burned the silken tricolor flags, or
cut them up; dividing the ashes or fragments
among their comrades.</p>

<p>Their Eagles taken away, it was next made
known to the Army, that the “battle honours”
and war distinctions of the various corps, won
under Napoleon, would not appear on the new
regimental flags when issued. “Austerlitz,”
“Jena,” “Friedland,” and the other names of
pride to the Grand Army, were henceforward to
be erased from military recognition. The new
flags, when publicly distributed in September
1814, showed each a blank white field, with on it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
only an oval shield, bearing the three fleurs-de-lis,
the Royal Bourbon cognisance, and the name
of the corps—its new name, revived from Army
Lists of the Old Monarchy, a name long since
forgotten and totally unfamiliar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO MORE REGIMENTAL NUMBERS</div>

<p>The regimental numbers of the Grand Army,
ennobled by glorious campaigns, immortalised
by their associations of victory and brilliant
feats of arms, instinct with a renown acquired on
a hundred battlefields all over Europe, were at
the same time done away with by a stroke of the
War Minister’s pen. That proved the most
unpopular measure of all; the cruellest of blows
to the <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> and pride of the former
soldiers of Napoleon. It was felt as a gratuitous
insult; it was perhaps the most deeply resented
injury of all. In future, in place of their treasured
regimental numbers, the various corps of the
Army, horse and foot, were to be known by
departmental or territorial names—meaningless
to nine soldiers out of ten, and without traditions—or
else by the names of royal princes and princesses,
and titled personages, remembered only,
some of them, as having fled on the battlefield
before the national armies. Bercheney and
Chamborant Hussars, Orléans Dragoons and
Chasseurs, Regiments d’Artois, de Berri, d’Armagnac,
d’Angoulême, de Monsieur, d’Anjou,
and so forth—what traditions had designations
such as these to compare with, to mention in the
same breath with, the traditions immortally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
associated with the numbers, familiar as household
words wherever French soldiers met together,
of the dragoon and chasseur regiments which
Murat had led at Austerlitz, of the dashing
hussars of Lassalle, of the cuirassiers whose
resistless onset had swept the field at Jena, of
the horsemen at the sight of whose sabres before
their gates Prussian fortresses had surrendered
at discretion? It came with a sense of personal
degradation, as a sort of desecration on the
men of regiments like the 75th of the Line, or the
32nd, the 9th Light Infantry or the 84th, or the
35th, or “Le terrible 57me”—to be labelled and
hear themselves officially addressed on parade
as “Beauvoisis” or “Auxerre” or “Nivernais,”
by the name of some prosaic locality, or the
style of some ancient aristocrat, their titular
colonel.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE HEAD OF THE “ELBA GUARD”</div>

<p>Napoleon announced the return of the Eagle
in his first address to the Army, sent off on his
landing to be distributed broadcast among the
soldiers. “Come and range yourselves under
the banners of your chief.... Victory shall
march at the <i lang="fr">pas de charge</i>: the Eagle with the
national colours shall fly from steeple to steeple
to the towers of Notre Dame!”</p>

<p>The first of the regimental Eagles to make its
appearance in France accompanied Napoleon
from Elba and landed with him. It was the
Eagle of the six hundred veterans of the Old
Guard who, as the “Elba Guard,” had volunteered
to share Napoleon’s exile, and had formed
his personal escort. It figured in the historic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
scene at Grenoble a week after the landing, where
Napoleon, on meeting the first soldiers sent to
arrest his advance, by the magic of his presence
and the sight of the Eagle borne behind him, so
dramatically won over to his side the former
5th of the Line, the first regiment of the Army to
throw in its lot with Napoleon after Elba. The
Eagle that had its part on the historic occasion—with
its silken tricolor flag, embroidered with
silver wreaths and scrollery, and golden bees,
crowns and Imperial cyphers, and inscribed
“L’Empereur Napoléon à la Garde Nationale de
l’Ile Elba”—is now in private possession in
England. It fell by some means into the hands
of a Prussian soldier at the occupation of Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
after Waterloo and was sold a few weeks later to
a visitor to Paris. In the dramatic scene of the
meeting of Napoleon with the 5th of the Line,
General Cambronne, Commander of the Elba
Guard, bore the Eagle a few paces behind
Napoleon and held it up appealingly to the
regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“LET ANY WHO WISHES—FIRE!”</div>

<p>The 5th of the Line, says one story, vouched
for by an eye-witness, was marching out to block
a narrow gorge through which ran the road
Napoleon was known to be taking. At some
little way off, his party was seen approaching, he
himself being readily recognised by his small
cocked hat and <i lang="fr">redingote gris</i>. Immediately the
men were formed up across the road, and, as
Napoleon came nearer, they were ordered to
make ready and present. They did so: the
muskets came up and were levelled. Then came
a pause; dead silence; an interval of breathless
suspense. Napoleon’s own action decided the
issue. Stepping rapidly forward, opening and
throwing back his great-coat as he did so, he
called aloud to the regiment: “Soldats, voilà
votre Empereur! Que celui d’entre vous qui
voudra le tuer, faire feu sur lui!” (“Soldiers, here
is your Emperor! Let any one who wishes to
kill him fire on him!”) A Royalist officer
hastily called out the order: “Le voilà! donnez
feu, soldats!” But not a shot came. The next
instant, with shouts of “Vive l’Empereur!” the
soldiers lowered their muskets, broke their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
ranks, and rushed forward to surround Napoleon
and welcome him in a frenzy of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>According to another story, this is what took
place. Before the word “Fire!” could be given,
Napoleon had stepped forward, close up to the
muzzles of the levelled muskets. With a smile
on his face he began in his usual colloquial,
familiar way when talking to the men: “Well,
soldiers of the 5th, how are you all? I am come
to see you again: is there any one of you who
wishes to kill me?” Shouts came in reply of
“No, no, Sire! certainly not!” The muskets
went down; Napoleon passed along the ranks,
inspecting the men just as of old; after that the
regiment faced about, took the lead of the party,
and, with Napoleon in the middle and the “Elba
Guard” bringing up the rear, all marched on
towards Grenoble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARSHAL NEY’S DILEMMA</div>

<p>There, meanwhile, events had been moving
rapidly. The commandant of the garrison was
an <i lang="fr">émigré</i> officer, but most of the troops had
been won over for Napoleon by Colonel Labédoyère,
at the head of the 7th of the Line. The
commandant ordered the gates to be closed,
which was done; also the cannon on the ramparts
to be loaded. That order was duly
obeyed; “but the men rammed home the
cannon-balls first, before putting in the powder,
so that the guns were useless.” Labédoyère
marched out with his regiment to meet Napoleon,
the band playing, “and carrying the Eagle of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
regiment, which had been concealed and preserved.”
They met Napoleon a short distance
from Grenoble and, with the 5th, led the way
in, arriving after dark. “On Napoleon’s approach,
the populace thronged the ramparts with
torches; the gates were burst open; Napoleon
was borne through the town in triumph by a
wild and intermingled crowd of soldiers and
workpeople.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span></p>

<p>Napoleon entered Paris on the night of
March 20. The Eagles made their first appearance
in the capital next day. They had been
officially restored as the standards of the Army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
by an Imperial decree issued on March 13 from
Lyons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AT THE FIRST REVIEW IN PARIS</div>

<p>Paris saw them again first at the review of the
garrison of the capital which Napoleon held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
within twenty-four hours of his arrival; on the
Place du Carrousel, in front of the Tuileries.
There too the Imperial Guard, reconstituted that
same morning, made their public reappearance.
In the midst of the brilliant scene, as Napoleon
was ending the address of personal thanks for
their loyalty that he made to the assembled
troops in dramatic style, suddenly General
Cambronne marched on to the parade at the
head of the Elba Six Hundred, with drums
beating and escorting the former Eagles of the
Guard. Drawing up in line ceremoniously, the
“Elba Guard” halted before Napoleon, saluting
and dipping the Eagles forward. A frantic
roar of enthusiastic cheering greeted the salute
of the Eagles.</p>

<p>Napoleon took instant advantage of the first
pause as the cheering subsided. Pointing to the
veterans just arrived, and standing with the
Eagles ranged in front of them, held on high at
arm’s-length by their bearers, he again addressed
the assembled troops. “They bring back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
you the Eagles which are to serve as your rallying-point.
In giving them to the Guard, I give them
to the whole Army. Treason and misfortune
have cast over them a veil of mourning; but
they now reappear resplendent in their old
glory. Swear to me, soldiers, that these Eagles
shall always be found where the welfare of the
nation calls them, and those who would invade
our land again shall not be able to endure their
glance!” “We swear it! We swear it!”
was the answer that came back amid tumultuous
shouts from every side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ONCE MORE THE FIELD OF MARS</div>

<p>The Eagles restored by proclamation as the
standards of the Army, and the regiments reconstituted
by their old numbers, to the unbounded
gratification of the soldiers everywhere, another
Imperial proclamation announced that Napoleon
would once again personally distribute new Eagles
to the regiments. The ceremony of the Field of
Mars of ten years before would be repeated.
The Emperor, with his own hand, would present
each Eagle to a regimental deputation, which
would specially attend in Paris to receive it. To
give the utmost possible <i lang="fr">éclat</i> also to the proceedings
on the occasion, just as the former
presentation of the Eagles had been made an
integral feature of the Coronation celebration, so
now the forthcoming distribution would take
place at the same time that Napoleon renewed
his Imperial oath of fidelity to the Constitution,
as reshaped by the “<i lang="fr">Acte Additionel</i>,” which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
had been drafted to comply with the political
exigencies of the moment.</p>

<p>The date provisionally fixed was towards the
end of May. By that time the returns of the
<i lang="fr">Plébiscite</i> voting, to authorise the re-establishment
of the Empire, would be known. The
historic event takes its name of the “<i lang="fr">Champ
de Mai</i>” from the date proposed for it, although,
in actual fact, the ceremony took place on
June 1. The place appointed was where the
former distribution of the Eagles had been made,
the Field of Mars, the wide open space in front of
the Military School, and the display was to be
on no less grandiose scale than its predecessor.</p>

<p>Immense wooden stands were erected all round
the Field of Mars, with tiers of benches, to seat,
it was calculated, as many as two hundred
thousand people. In front of the Military School
was set up an Imperial throne, under a canopy
of crimson silk, and elevated on a gorgeously
decorated platform. Napoleon was to take his
new Imperial oath from the throne, and thereupon
formally attach his signature to the “<i lang="fr">Acte
Additionel</i>.” There was to be a religious service
also, and for that an altar was erected at
one side of the throne, raised on steps and
draped in red damask, picked out with gold.
The balconies and stands all round were draped
and hung with tricolor flags, festooned amid
gilded Eagles, and heraldic insignia, and emblematic
figures meant to typify the prosperity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
and glory awaiting France under the returned
Imperial <i lang="fr">régime</i>. As on the previous occasion,
all the celebrities of France were invited, and
had their allotted places on the stands nearest
the throne. As before, too, the central arena
was packed with a dense array of troops; the
deputations called up to receive the Eagles, the
massed battalions of the Imperial Guard, and
detachments of all the regiments of the garrison
of Paris. It was a radiantly fine summer’s day,
and the display offered a spectacle of surpassing
brilliance. Says one of the officers: “The sun
flashing on 50,000 bayonets seemed to make
the vast space sparkle!”</p>

<p>A hundred cannon fired from the Esplanade of
the Invalides ushered in the day of the “<i lang="fr">Champ
de Mai</i>.” Again, at ten o’clock, the artillery
thundered forth as Napoleon quitted the
Tuileries in State to take his way to the Field
of Mars, “amid prodigious crowds of spectators
applauding enthusiastically,” along the Champs
Elysées and across the Pont d’Jéna.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NINE MARSHALS TAKE PART</div>

<p>Nine of the marshals who had cast in their
lot with the returned Emperor rode on either side
of Napoleon’s coach: Davout, Minister of War,
who had not yet sworn allegiance to the Bourbons;
Soult, the newly appointed Chief of the
Staff of the Army; Serrurier, Governor of the
Invalides; Brune and Jourdan; Moncey and
Mortier; Suchet and Grouchy. Ney was absent;
Napoleon had refused to see him. Ney’s widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
reported speech to Louis XVIII., that he would
“bring the bandit to Paris in an iron cage,” had
not been forgiven. Murat was in disgrace for
his recent blundering move in Northern Italy,
which had vitally affected Napoleon’s plans.
His desertion during the closing campaign, when
Napoleon was at bay after Leipsic, moreover,
was beyond condonation. Of others who had
been at Napoleon’s side on the Field of Mars ten
years before, Lefebvre and Masséna professed
to be too old and infirm for service in the field,
although Masséna was still nominally on the
Active List, and had been in command for King
Louis at Toulon. He was due in Paris to meet
Napoleon, but his fidelity was more than doubtful:
“gorged with wealth, Masséna thought
only of preserving it.” Augereau kept in the
background, Napoleon refusing to have more to
do with him. Berthier, on that very morning, was
lying dead at Bamberg in Bavaria; whether
victim of an accident or suicide has never been
made clear. Lannes and Bessières were in their
graves, fallen on the field of battle. Bernadotte,
King of Sweden, was actively on the side of the
enemy. Marmont, Oudinot, Macdonald, and
Victor, marshals of later creation, had left
France in company with the Bourbon princes.
Old Kellerman and Perignon, “Honorary Marshals”
of 1804, had not come forward again, remaining
in seclusion; nor had St. Cyr, “the
man of ice,” another marshal since the Field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
of Mars, who was staying at home with studied
indifference, “occupying himself on his estate
with his hay crops and playing the fiddle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “MAN OF SEDAN” WAS THERE</div>

<p>Napoleon was accompanied in the State coach
by three of his brothers—Lucien, Joseph, and
Jerome. This time there was of course no
Empress present. Josephine was dead: Marie
Louise was holding back elsewhere. None of
the Bonaparte princesses appeared in the procession.
The only one attending the “<i lang="fr">Champ de
Mai</i>” came as a spectator: Hortense Beauharnais,
the daughter of Josephine and wife of Louis
Bonaparte. She had gone on in advance to the
Military School and was seated among the
exalted personages awaiting Napoleon there;
accompanied by her two boys (one the future
Third Napoleon, the “Man of Sedan”). She
seemed most interested, as we are told, in the
sketch-book she brought with her to draw a
picture of the scene.</p>

<p>Napoleon alighted in the First Court of the
Military School, being acclaimed on all sides as
he made his appearance with vociferous shouts
of “Vive l’Empereur!” Preceded by palace
grandees and Court officials, who had alighted
from their carriages in advance and formed up
to receive him, he entered the building and
passed on through to take his seat on the throne.
“He had the air of being in pain and anxious,”
describes an onlooker. “He descended slowly
from his carriage while a hundred drums beat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
‘<i lang="fr">Au Champ</i>.’ Then, advancing quickly, returning
the salutes of the assemblage at either
side with bows, he proceeded to the throne, and
sat down, gazing round at the people in their
dense masses as he did so. Jerome and Joseph
seated themselves on the right; Lucien on the
left; all three clad in white satin with black
velvet hats with white plumes. Napoleon himself
had on his Imperial mantle of ermine and
purple velvet embroidered with golden bees.”</p>

<p>For a time the thundering cannon salutes
and acclamations of the people that hailed
Napoleon’s appearance on the daïs were deafening.
Bowing repeatedly on every side, he took
his seat on the throne, while all present stood
and remained uncovered. The guns then ceased,
the music of the bands and the drummings and
trumpetings of the battalions died away into
silence. On that the ceremony of the day
opened with the celebration of High Mass by the
Archbishop of Tours.</p>

<p>The religious portion of the pageant, we are
told, “seemed to arouse no interest in Napoleon.
His opera-glass wandered all the time over the
immense multitude before him.” His attention
was not recalled until the Mass was over, when
the delegates from the Electoral College, marshalled
by the Master of the Ceremonies, ascended
the platform, and ranged themselves
before the throne. A Deputy stepped forward,
and after deep obeisance, in a loud resonant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
voice read an address teeming with sentiments
of patriotic attachment and expressing inviolable
fidelity towards the Emperor personally.
Napoleon seemed to listen with interest,
“marking his approbation with nods and
smiles.” The Deputy ceased speaking amidst
rapturous applause, and then Arch-Chancellor
Cambacérès, resplendent in a gorgeous orange-yellow
robe, stood forward in front of Napoleon
to notify officially the popular acceptance of the
new national Constitution. He declared the
total of the votes given in the <i lang="fr">Plébiscite</i> to show
a clear million in favour of the restoration of the
Empire. There was a flourish of trumpets, and
forthwith the chief herald proclaimed that the
“Additional Act to the Constitution of the
Empire” had been agreed to by the French
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON SIGNS THE ACT</div>

<p>Again from all round thundered out an
artillery salute, and the whole assembly rose to
their feet and cheered. A small gilded table
was brought forward and placed before Napoleon,
who, the Arch-Chancellor holding the parchment
open, and Joseph Bonaparte presenting the pen,
publicly ratified the Act with his formal signature.
The air resounded once more with the cannon
firing and noisy acclamations on all sides.</p>

<p>Napoleon rose, when at length the cheering
ceased, to address the assembly with one of his
most impassioned dramatic harangues. “Emperor,
Consul, Soldier, I hold everything from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
the people! In prosperity and in adversity; in
the field, in the council; in power, in exile,
France has been the sole and constant object of
my thoughts and actions!” So he began. He
closed in the same vein: “Frenchmen! my
will is that of my people; my rights are theirs;
my honour, my glory, my happiness, can never
be separated from the honour, glory, and happiness
of France!”</p>

<p>Again came the outburst of rapturous applause.
It subsided, and the Archbishop of Bourges, as
Grand Almoner of the Empire, came forward.
Kneeling before Napoleon he presented the
Book of the Gospels, on which Napoleon solemnly
took the Imperial Oath to observe the new
Constitution. There only remained for Arch-Chancellor
Cambacérès and the principal officers
of State to take their oaths of allegiance to
the Constitution and the Emperor, and after
that a solemn Te Deum closed the political
ceremony.</p>

<p>It was now the turn of the Eagles and the
Army. The civilian personages withdrew from
the steps of the throne; the electoral deputations
fell back; leaving a clear open space in
front. Immediately, as if by magic, the Eagles
suddenly appeared; long rows of them flashing
and glittering in the brilliant sunshine. They
were brought forward in procession, advancing
in massed rows “resplendent and dazzling like
gold.” Carnot, Minister of the Interior, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
“Organiser of Victory” of the Armies of the
Revolution, headed the procession, “clad in a
Spanish white dress of great magnificence,”
carrying the First Eagle of the National Guard of
Paris. Next him came Marshal Davout, Minister
of War, carrying the Eagle of the 1st Regiment
of the Line, and then Admiral Decrès, Minister
of Marine (as representing the French Navy),
carrying the Eagle of Napoleon’s 1st Regiment
of Marines. General Count Friant (he fell at
Waterloo), as Colonel-in-Chief, bore the Eagle
of the Imperial Guard. Other officers of exalted
rank bore other Eagles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPRINGING FORWARD TO MEET THEM</div>

<p>Napoleon’s demeanour, hitherto, for most
of the time, formal and apathetic, altered instantaneously
at the appearance of the Eagles.
“He sprang from the throne, and, casting aside
his purple mantle, rushed forward to meet his
Eagles”; amid a sudden hush that seemed
to fall over the whole assembly at the sight.
Then the momentary silence was broken. An
enthusiastic shout went up as the Emperor,
pressing forward impetuously, as though
electrified with sudden energy, took up his
station immediately in front of the array of
soldiers, the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of the veterans of the old
Grand Army left alive, as they stood there
formed up in an immense phalanx. To the
sound of martial music the regimental deputations
forthwith moved up and advanced to pass
before him. Napoleon, with a gesture of deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
reverence, took each Eagle into his own hands
from the officer who had been carrying it, and
then delivered it with stately formality to its
future regimental bearer as the deputations in
turn filed past him.</p>

<p>He had a word for the men of every corps as
each set of ten officers and men drew up before
him. To some he said, glancing at the number
of their regiment on their shakos, “I remember
you well. You are my old companions of
Italy!” or, “You are my comrades of Egypt!”
and so on. Others he reminded of past days of
distinction. “You were with me at Arcola!”
he said to one group, or “at Rivoli!” “at
Austerlitz!” “at Friedland!” to others, as
might be—his words, we are told, “inspiring
the men with deep emotion.” For each of the
National Guard deputations he had also their
little speech. To one detachment for instance,
as it came up, he said: “You are my old companions
from the Rhine; you have been the
foremost, the most courageous, the most unfortunate
in our disasters; but I remember all!”</p>

<p>The last Eagle presented, Napoleon called on
the soldiers to take the Army Oath of fidelity
to the Standard, using his customary Eagle
oration formula.</p>

<p>“Soldiers of the National Guard of the
Empire!” he began, “Soldiers of my Imperial
Guard! Soldiers of the Line on land and sea!
I entrust to your hands the Imperial Eagle!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
You swear here to defend it at the cost of your
life’s blood against the enemies of the nation.
You swear that it will always be your guiding
sign, your rallying point!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMIDST A TUMULT OF ENTHUSIASM</div>

<p>Some of those nearest interrupted Napoleon
with shouts of “We swear!” He went on:
“You swear never to acknowledge any other
standard!” The shouts of “We swear!” again
broke in vociferously.</p>

<p>Napoleon again went on: “You, Soldiers of
the National Guard of Paris, swear never to
permit the foreigner to desecrate again the
capital of the Great Nation! To your courage
I commit it!” Cries of “We swear!”
repeated continuously amidst a tumult of
clamour, once more burst forth.</p>

<p>Napoleon continued and concluded, turning
to his favourite Pretorians: “Soldiers of the
Imperial Guard, swear to surpass yourselves in
the campaign which is now about to open, to
die round your Eagles rather than permit
foreigners to dictate terms to your country!”
He ceased after that, and once again the air
vibrated with shouts of “We swear! We swear!”
and ejaculations of “Vive l’Empereur!” from
the soldiers and the throng of onlookers cramming
the stands around.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span></p>

<p>The military <i lang="fr">finale</i> of the day was the march
past of the assembled troops before the Emperor,
in slow time, headed by the Eagles.
“Nothing could have been more imposing,”
says one of the spectators, “than this concluding
display in the magnificent pageant.
Amid the crash of military music, the blaze of
martial decoration, the glitter of innumerable
arms, 50,000 men passed by. The immense
concourse of beholders, their prolonged shouts
and cheers, the occasion, the Man, the mighty
events which hung in suspense, all concurred
to excite feelings and reflections which only
such a scene could have produced.” On the
other hand, we have this from a colder critic
of the scene: “The display was without heart,
and theatrical; the vows of the soldiers were
made without warmth. There was but little
real enthusiasm: the shouts were not those of
future victors of another Austerlitz and Wagram,
and the Emperor knew it!” Which are we to
believe?</p>

<p>According to Savary, who was close beside
him, Napoleon, for his part, was satisfied with
the enthusiasm of the soldiers. “The Emperor
left the Field of Mars confident that he might
rely on the sentiments then manifested towards
him, and from that moment his only care was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
to meet the storm that was forming in
Belgium.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE REGIMENTAL PARADES</div>

<p>The new Eagles left Paris that night with their
escorts. Each, on its arrival where its regiment
was stationed, was received with elaborate
ceremony, and formally presented on parade to
the assembled officers and men; a religious
service being held in addition in some cases, at
which all were sworn individually to give their
lives in its defence. This, for instance, is what
took place with one regiment, the 22nd of the
Line, stationed with the advanced division of
Grouchy’s Army Corps on the Belgian frontier
at Couvins, near Rocroy, in the Ardennes.
“The new Eagle,” describes one of the officers,
“all fresh from the gilder’s shop, was solemnly
blessed in the church of Couvins; then each
soldier, touching it with his hand, swore individually
to defend it to the death. After the religious
service the regiment formed in square, and the
colonel delivered an address, in which he recalled
the old glories of the 22nd of the Line, and
expressed his conviction that the regiment would
worthily uphold the old-time fame of the corps
in the coming campaign. The glowing language
was received with great emotion, and as of happy
augury for the future.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Eagles figure in four episodes in the story
of Waterloo.</p>

<p>They had their part at the outset in that intensely
dramatic display on the morning of the
battle, when, before the eyes of Wellington’s
soldiers, drawn up with muskets loaded and
bayonets fixed, and guns in position ready to open
fire, Napoleon passed his army in review; the last
parade of the Last Army on the day of its last
battle. Said Napoleon himself afterwards, in
words that are in keeping with the resplendent
spectacle: “The earth seemed proud to bear
so many brave men!” (“La terre paraissait
orgueilleuse de porter tant de braves!”)</p>

<p>It was a little after nine in the morning that
the Last Army of Napoleon moved out from its
bivouacs of the night before to take up its station
for the battle. This is how a British hussar,
who was looking on, describes the opening of the
wonderful show: “Marching in eleven columns
they came up to the front and deployed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
rapidity, precision, and fine scenic effect. The
drums beat, the bands played, the trumpets
sounded. The light troops in front pressed forward,
and the rattle of musketry was followed
by the retreat of our horsemen and foot soldiers.
Light wreaths of smoke curled upwards into the
misty air, and through this thin veil the dense dark
columns of the French infantry and the gay and
gleaming squadrons of French horse were seen
moving into their positions. Before them was
the open valley, yet green with the heavy crops;
behind them dark fringes of wood, and a thick
curtain of dreary cloud.</p>

<p>“The French bands struck up so that we could
distinctly hear them. Not long after, the
enemy’s skirmishers, backed by their supports,
were thrown out; extending as they advanced,
they spread over the whole space before them.
Now and then they saluted our ears with well-known
music, the whistling of musket-balls.
Their columns, preceded by mounted officers to
take up the alignments, soon began to appear;
the bayonets flashing over dark masses at different
points, accompanied by the rattling of drums
and the clang of trumpets.</p>

<p>“They took post, their infantry in front, in
two lines, 60 yards apart, flanked by lancers with
their fluttering flags. In rear of the centre of
the infantry wings were the cuirassiers, also in
two lines. In rear of the cuirassiers, on the
right, the lancers and chasseurs of the Imperial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
Guard, in their splendid but gaudy uniforms:
the former clad in scarlet; the latter, like hussars,
in rifle-green, fur-trimmed pelisse, gold lace,
bearskin cap. In rear of the cuirassiers, on the
left, were the horse-grenadiers and dragoons of
the Imperial Guard, with their dazzling arms.
Immediately in rear of the centre was the reserve,
composed of the 6th Corps, in columns; on the
left, and on the right of the Genappe road,
were two divisions of light cavalry. In rear of
the whole was the infantry of the Imperial
Guard in columns, a dense dark mass, which, with
the 6th Corps and cavalry, were flanked by their
numerous artillery. Nearly 72,000 men, and
246 guns, ranged with matches lighted, gave an
awful presage of the approaching conflict.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AS THEY MARCHED ON TO THE FIELD</div>

<p>Napoleon rode out to watch them as they
deployed into position. He took his stand at
the point where the columns reached the field
and wheeled off to right and left to form up in
readiness for the signal that should launch their
massed ranks forward across the intervening
valley against the British position in front.
Marshal Soult, Chief of the General Staff, rode
close behind Napoleon on one side; Marshal
Ney, in charge of the main attack that day, was
on the other. In rear followed in glittering
array the cavalcade of staff officers, with, dragged
along after them, tied by a rope to a dragoon
orderly, Napoleon’s Waterloo guide, the innkeeper
De Coster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>Hardly had Napoleon himself ever witnessed
before the like of the tremendous display of
enthusiasm that greeted his presence on the
field on the morning of that final day. “The
drums beat; the trumpets sounded; the bands
struck up ‘Veillons au salut de l’Empire.’ As
they passed Napoleon the standard-bearers
drooped the Eagles; the cavalrymen waved their
sabres; the infantrymen held on high their
shakos on their bayonets. The roar of cheers
dominated and drowned the beat of the drums
and the blare of the trumpets. The ‘<i lang="fr">Vive
l’Empereurs!</i>’ followed with such vehemence
and such rapidity that no commands could be
heard. And what rendered the scene all the more
solemn, all the more moving, was the fact that
before us, a thousand paces away perhaps, we
could see distinctly the dull red line [“la ligne
rouge sombre”] of the English army.”</p>

<p>So one French officer (Captain Martin of the
45th of the Line) describes. The shouts of
“Vive l’Empereur!” says another, a veteran
of Count d’Erlon’s First Army Corps, “rose
more vehemently, louder and longer than I ever
heard before, for our men were determined that
they should be heard among the brick-red lines
which fringed the crest of Mont Saint-Jean.”</p>

<p>It was for the Eagles the counterpart of the
Day of the Field of Mars, the culminating act of
homage to Napoleon from the soldiers of the
Grand Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">HIS IN LIFE AND DEATH</div>

<p>“The sight of him,” if we may use the words
of Lamartine, “was for some a recompense for
their death, for others an incitement to victory!
One heart beat between these men and the Emperor.
In such a moment they shared the same
soul and the same cause! When all is risked for
one man, it is in him his followers live and die.
The army was Napoleon! Never before was
it so entirely Napoleon as now. He was repudiated
by Europe, and his army had adopted him
with idolatry; it voluntarily made itself the
great martyr of his glory. At such a moment
he must have felt himself more than man, more
than a sovereign. His subjects only bowed to
his power, Europe to his genius; but his army
bent in homage to the past, the present, and the
future, and welcomed victory or defeat, the
throne or death with its chief. It was determined
on everything, even on the sacrifice of
itself, to restore him his Empire, or to render his
last fall illustrious. Accomplices at Grenoble,
Pretorians at Paris, victims at Waterloo: such
a sentiment in the generals and officers of Napoleon
had in it nothing that was not in conformity
with the habits and even the vices of humanity.
His cause was their cause, his crime their crime,
his power their power, his glory their glory.
But the devotion of those 80,000 soldiers was
more virtuous, for it was more disinterested.
Who would know their names? Who would pay
them for the shedding of their blood? The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
plain before them would not even preserve their
bones! To have inspired such a devotion was
the greatness of Napoleon; to evince it even to
madness was the greatness of his Army!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOME WHO HAD MET BEFORE</div>

<p>They knew, too, not a few of them, the stamp
of men they were about to meet. Never before
that day, of course, had Napoleon met British
soldiers on the battlefield; but there were
others present who had, and a good many of
them.</p>

<p>Many a French regiment at Waterloo had old
scores of their own to settle, past days to avenge.
The 8th of the Line, the fate of whose “Eagle
with the Golden Wreath” at Barrosa has been
recorded, were on the field, and dipped their
glittering new Eagle, received at the “<i lang="fr">Champ de
Mai</i>,” in salute as they passed Napoleon that
morning. So too did the 82nd, whose former
battalion Eagles from Martinique are at Chelsea
now; the 13th of the Line and the 51st, who lost
their regimental Eagles in the Retiro arsenal of
Madrid; the 28th, who met their fate, and lost
their Eagle under the bullets of the British 28th
in the Pyrenees. Others were there who had
fought against Wellington in Spain, and, more
fortunate, had preserved their Eagles. Among
these were the 47th, who on the battlefield at
Barrosa lost and regained their Eagle; and the
105th, mindful yet of their terrible Salamanca
experience of what dragoon swords in strong
hands could do. The 105th were destined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
soldiers and Eagle alike, to undergo a fate more
fearful still, ere the sun should set that day.</p>

<p>Two of the regiments that paraded before
Napoleon to meet the soldiers of Wellington
had met under fire the sailors of Nelson at
Trafalgar: the 2nd of the Line, now in Jerome
Bonaparte’s division of Reille’s Army Corps,
and the 16th, serving with the Sixth Corps. A
third regiment, the 70th, which did duty as
marines at Trafalgar, was with Grouchy, not
many miles away; as was the 22nd of the Line,
whose Eagle, taken at Salamanca, is at Chelsea
Hospital, and the 34th, whose drum-major’s staff
is to this day a prized trophy of the British 34th
(now the First Battalion of the Border Regiment),
won in Spain, when, as it so befell, two
regiments bearing the same number crossed
bayonets on the battlefield.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The famous 84th of the Line were at Waterloo,
with their proud legend, “Un contre dix,” restored
at the “<i lang="fr">Champ de Mai</i>,” flaunting proudly
on their new silken flag as the Eagle bent in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
salute to Napoleon; also, the hardly less widely
renowned 46th, the corps of the First Grenadier
of France, La Tour d’Auvergne, whose name was
called at the head of the list at that morning’s
roll-call and answered with the customary answer,
“Dead on the Field of Honour”; also, too, Napoleon’s
former-time favourite, the 75th, mindful
still on that last day of their glorious youth when
“Le 75me arrive et bât l’ennemi”—a motto
that an earlier colonel of the corps had proposed
once to replace on the flag by “Veni, Vidi, Vici.”</p>

<p>The Old Guard paraded in their fighting kit,
with, as usual, in their knapsacks their full-dress
uniforms, carried in readiness to be put on for
Napoleon’s triumphal entry into Brussels.</p>

<p>Drouet d’Erlon rode past at the head of the
First Army Corps; Count of the Empire in
virtue of his rank as a general; once upon a
time the little son of the postmaster at Varennes,
where Louis Seize and Marie Antoinette so pitifully
ended their attempted flight, harsh old
Drouet, ex-sergeant of Condé dragoons, from
whom he inherited his talent for soldiering.
General Reille led past the Second Corps. He,
curiously, had had something of a naval past.
He had hardly forgotten that other battle-day
morning, when he galloped on to the field of
Austerlitz, and reported himself to the Emperor
as having come direct from Cadiz, put ashore
from the doomed French fleet of Admiral Villeneuve
just a week before it sailed to fight Trafalgar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
Both Reille and his men, above all others,
were burning with excitement and eagerness
that day to get at the enemy. They had missed
taking part either at Ligny or Quatre Bras,
through contradictory orders which had kept
them marching and counter-marching between
the two battlefields; unable to reach either
in time. Smarting under the reproach that
they had been useless in the campaign, though
the pick of the Line was in their ranks, the
men one and all were burning to retrieve their
reputation.</p>

<p>Count Lobau—he took his name from the island
in the Danube which played so vital a part in
the battle of Aspern—was at the head of the
Sixth Corps, the third of Napoleon’s grand
divisions of the army at Waterloo. Formerly
General Mouton, Napoleon renamed him when
he made him a Count for his skill and heroism
at Aspern. “Mon Mouton,” said Napoleon
of him once as he watched the general in action,
“est un lion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON IN HIGH SPIRITS</div>

<p>Napoleon himself was in the highest spirits,
full of pride and confidence. In that mood had
he announced his intention of holding the review.
There was no need to hurry, he said; Blücher
and Wellington had been driven apart. The
parade would pass the time while waiting for the
soaked ground to get dry, and make it easier for
the guns to move from point to point. And
there was also this. The spectacle would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
assuredly a disquieting effect on the Dutch and
Belgians in Wellington’s army. Many of the
men in front of him had served with the Eagles
in former days: all stood nervously in awe, it
was notorious, of the mighty name and reputation
of Napoleon. Hesitating, as some were
known to be, between their fears and their patriotism,
the influence of the imposing spectacle
might well—believed Napoleon—turn the scale
and induce them to come over.</p>

<p>This was Napoleon’s plan for the battle, as
outlined that morning to his brother Jerome.
First would be the general preparation for attack
by a tremendous cannonade all along the line
from massed batteries. On that, the two army
corps of D’Erlon and Reille would advance
simultaneously and assault in front, supported
by cavalry charges of cuirassiers. Then, if the
English had not yet been beaten, would follow
the final assault, the crushing blow that it would
be impossible to resist; to be delivered by the
remaining army corps of Lobau and the Young
Guard, supported by the Middle Guard and the
Old Guard. So Napoleon planned to fight and
win at Waterloo.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“THE GAME IS WITH US”</div>

<p>Of the ultimate issue of the day he flattered
himself there could be no two opinions. “At
the last I have them, these English!” “(Enfin
je les tiens, ces Anglais!”) he exclaimed
jubilantly as he reconnoitred Wellington’s position
in the early morning. At breakfast with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
the two Marshals, Soult and Ney, he declared that
the odds were 90 to 10 in his favour. “Wellington,”
he said to Ney, “has thrown the dice, and
the game is with us.”</p>

<p>He turned fiercely on Soult, who, knowing the
mettle of the British soldier from experience,
had entreated him to recall Grouchy’s 30,000
men from watching the Prussians near Wavre.</p>

<p>“You think because Wellington has defeated
you, that he must be a very great general! I
tell you he is a bad general, and the English are
but poor troops! This, for us, will only be an
affair of a <i lang="fr">déjeuner</i>—a picnic!”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” was all that Soult said in reply.</p>

<p>At that moment Reille and General Foy,
experienced Peninsular veterans both, whose
opinions should have had weight, were announced.
Said Reille, in reply to Napoleon’s asking what
he thought: “If well placed, as Wellington
knows how to draw up his men, and if attacked
in front, the English infantry is invincible, by
reason of its calm tenacity and the superiority
of its fire. Before coming to close quarters with
the bayonet we must expect to see half the
assaulting troops out of action.”</p>

<p>Interposed Foy: “Wellington never shows
his troops, but if he is yonder, I must warn your
Majesty that the English infantry in close combat
is the very devil!” (“L’infanterie Anglaise
en duel c’est le diable!”)</p>

<p>Napoleon lost his temper. With an exclamation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
of angry incredulity he rose hastily from
the breakfast table, and the party broke up.</p>

<p>He spent a great part of the day watching the
battle from a little mound, a short distance from
the farm of Rossomme; mostly pacing to and
fro, his hands behind his back; at times violently
taking snuff, occasionally gesticulating excitedly.
Near by was a kitchen table from the farmhouse,
covered with maps weighted down with stones,
with a chair placed on some straw, on which at
intervals he rested. Soult kept ever near at
hand, and the staff remained a little in rear.
It was not until the afternoon was well advanced
that Napoleon got again on horseback.</p>

<p>As related by the guide De Coster in conversation
with an English questioner a few months
after Waterloo, this is what passed:</p>

<p>“He had frequent communications with his
aides de camp during the day?”</p>

<p>“Every moment.”</p>

<p>“And when they reported what was going
on?”</p>

<p>“His orders were always ‘Avancez!’”</p>

<p>“Did he eat or drink during the day?”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Did he take snuff?”</p>

<p>“In abundance.”</p>

<p>“Did he talk much?”</p>

<p>“Never, except when he gave orders.”</p>

<p>“What was the general character of his countenance
during the day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WHEN THE LAST CHARGE FAILED</div>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Riante!</i>—till the last charge failed.”</p>

<p>“How did he look then?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Blanc-mort!</i>”</p>

<p>“Did he say ‘<i lang="fr">Sauve qui peut</i>’?”</p>

<p>“No! When he saw the English infantry rush

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span></p>

<h3 id="toclink_388"><span class="smcap">How Wellington’s Trophies were won</span></h3>

<p>It was in Napoleon’s second grand attack that
our two Waterloo Eagle-trophies, the most
famous spoils ever won by the British Army,
came into Wellington’s hands.</p>

<p>The first attack began about half-past eleven,
when Reille’s corps, on the French left, made its
opening effort against Hougoumont. Intended
by Napoleon at the outset rather as a feint to
mislead Wellington into fixing his attention on
that side, the stubborn defence of Hougoumont
involved the Second Corps in a struggle that
kept it fully occupied for the whole day; unable
to take part or be of use elsewhere.</p>

<p>The second grand attack took place shortly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
after two in the afternoon, when Marshal Ney
made his tremendous onslaught with thirty-three
battalions of Drouet d’Erlon’s First Army
Corps on the left-centre of the British position,
to the east of the Charleroi road, where
Picton’s men held the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DARK OBJECT IN THE HAZE</div>

<p>The launching of Ney’s attack just then came
about as the result of Napoleon’s sudden and
disquieting discovery that the Prussians were
approaching. It was to have opened an hour
earlier, but, because of that, had been held back
at the last moment. Napoleon, while looking
round with the idea that Grouchy’s troops might
be in sight in that quarter, made the discovery
with his own eyes. Those round him, indeed, at
first doubted what the dark object—which appeared
in the hazy atmosphere like a shadow on
the high ground near Mont Saint-Lambert, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
six miles off to the north-east—really was. Soult
at first could make out nothing; then he was
positive it was a column of troops—probably
Grouchy’s. The staff, scanning the suspicious
neighbourhood with their telescopes, asserted
that what the Emperor saw was only a wood.
The arrival of some hussars with a Prussian
prisoner, whom they had just captured while
trying to get round with a despatch from Bülow
to Wellington to announce the approach of the
Prussian Fourth Corps, settled the question.</p>

<p>Napoleon paced backwards and forwards for
a minute, taking pinches of snuff incessantly.
Then he ordered off his Light Cavalry to reconnoitre;
dictated to Soult an urgent message
recalling Grouchy; and sent off an aide de
camp to tell Lobau to wheel the Sixth Corps to
the right, facing towards Saint-Lambert. After
that he gave Ney orders to open his attack.</p>

<p>Ney took in hand his work forthwith, and
at once a terrific cannonade opened. Eighty
French field-guns, a third of Napoleon’s artillery
on the field, began firing together from the
plateau in front of La Belle Alliance; storming
furiously with shot and shell to break down
the British resistance, and clear the way for
the onset of the charging columns. Without
slackening an instant the guns thundered incessantly
for nearly an hour; getting back from
the British artillery in reply a fire that was at
least as vigorous and no less effective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“EN AVANT!” “VIVE L’EMPEREUR!”</div>

<p>Then Ney gave the word to advance.</p>

<p>Immediately the French infantry were on the
move. They went forward massed in four
divisions; in four solid columns of from four to
five thousand men each, advancing <i lang="fr">en échelon</i>
from the left, with intervals between of about
four hundred paces. Eight battalions made up
each column, except that of the second division,
which had nine. The battalions stood drawn
up in lines, three deep, with a front of two hundred
files. They were packed closely, one behind
the other; with intervals between, from front
to rear, of only five paces. So closely were they
wedged together, that there was barely room
between the battalions for the company officers.
Two brigadiers, Quiot and Bourgeois, led the
left column, General Allix, their chief, being
elsewhere; General Donzelot, a keen soldier
and universally popular as the best hearted and
most genial of good fellows, headed the second
column; Marcognet, a grim, hard-bitten veteran,
a prime favourite with Marshal Ney for
his dogged determination in action, had the
third; General Durutte was in charge of the
fourth, away to the right.</p>

<p>With their battalion-drums jauntily rattling
out the <i lang="fr">pas de charge</i>, amid excited cries and
loud exultant shouts of “En avant!” “Vive
l’Empereur!” the columns stepped off. Ahead
of them raced forward at a run swarming
crowds of <i lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>; extending fan-wise as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
went, spreading out widely across the front in
skirmishing array. The four massed columns
surged quickly forward and over the edge of
the plateau down the slope on to the space of
shallow valley between the armies. As they
did so, from the moment they crossed the crest-line
and dipped below, a fierce hurricane of fire
beat in their faces. Round-shot and shrapnel
swept the columns through and through, tearing
long bloody lanes through the densely packed
masses of men.</p>

<p>Marshal Ney accompanied the first column
for some part of the way, riding by the side
of Drouet d’Erlon.</p>

<p>As they crossed the intervening ground below,
the death-dealing British guns fired down on
them incessantly, but in spite of all, they stoutheartedly
moved forward, without checking
their pace. It was terribly toilsome work in
places: now they had to plough laboriously over
sodden and slippery ground; now to trample
their way through cornfields with standing grain-crops
nearly breast-high, or, where trodden
down, tangling round the men’s feet.</p>

<p>Quiot’s brigade turned off to attack La Haye
Sainte, but the rest of the division, Bourgeois’
men and the three other columns, held on their
way, moving in dense phalanxes of gleaming
bayonets up the slopes.</p>

<p>The second column, Donzelot’s, reached the top
a little in advance of the others, and was met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
by Kempt’s brigade of Picton’s troops, which
charged it and forced it to yield ground.</p>

<p>A moment later Marcognet’s column reached
the British line, coming up over the crest of the
hill immediately in front of Picton’s Highland
Brigade.</p>

<p>Received with a furious outburst of musketry
from all along the extended British line, Marcognet’s
leading files were thrown into some
confusion by the hail of bullets. They were,
however, veterans, and though their ranks were
shaken, they still pressed on, amid a tumult of
fierce cries and shouts of “Vive l’Empereur!”
and the wild clash and rattle of their drums.</p>

<p>But they got no farther. The British brigadier
on the spot, Sir Dennis Pack, called on the
nearest Highland regiment, the 92nd, to charge
them with the bayonet. A moment after that,
all unexpectedly, the cavalry of the Union
Brigade were on them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HIGHLANDERS DASH FORWARD</div>

<p>The Highlanders dashed forward with exultant
cheers and levelled bayonets, taking the French
volley that met them without firing back a shot.
They did not, however, get up to the French,
nor actually cross steel on steel. As the Highlanders
got within a dozen yards the column
suddenly stopped short, and some of the men in
front seemed suddenly to be panic-stricken. A
moment before all were madly yelling out:
“Forward!” “Victory!” Now they began to
turn their backs in disorder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

<p>It was not, though, at the sight of the bayonets.
They had seen and heard something else. The
thundering beat of approaching horse-hoofs
shook the ground.</p>

<p>With a trampling turmoil of horse-hoofs the
cavalrymen of the British Union Brigade burst
on the scene, galloping forward from their
former post in rear of Picton’s infantry. The
Scots Greys were on the left; the Inniskillings
in the centre; the Royal Dragoons on the right.</p>

<p>Marcognet’s men heard their approach, and
the next moment saw the horsemen coming at
them. The unexpected sight startled and staggered
them; and some of those in the front line
gave way. The alarm spread at once, as most
of the rest realised what was approaching. The
whole column swayed to and fro violently.
Then it lost cohesion and began to roll back in
mingled ranks down-hill.</p>

<p>A moment later the Greys were among them.
“The smoke in which the head of the French
column was enshrouded had not cleared away
when the Greys dashed into the mass.</p>

<p>“Highlanders and Greys charged together,
while shrill and wild from the Highland ranks
sounded the mountain pipe, mingled with shouts
of ‘Scotland for ever!’” So an officer describes.
The men of the 92nd seized hold of the stirrup-leathers
of the horsemen, and charged with them.
“All rushed forward, leaving none but the disabled
in their rear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A SHOUT OF “ATTENTION! CAVALRY!”</div>

<p>“The dragoons,” describes Captain Siborne,
“having the advantage of the descent, appeared
to mow down the mass, which, bending under
the pressure, quickly spread itself outwards in
all directions. Yet in that mass were many
gallant spirits who could not be brought to
yield without a struggle; and these fought
bravely to the death.”</p>

<p>Says some one on the French side: “We
heard a shout of ‘Attention! Cavalry!’
Almost at the same instant a crowd of red
dragoons mounted on grey horses swept down
upon us like the wind. Those who had straggled
were cut to pieces without mercy. They did
not fall upon our columns to ride through and
break us up—we were too deep and massive for
that; but they came down between the divisions,
slashing right and left with their sabres and
spurring their horses into the flanks of the
columns to cut them in two. Though they did
not succeed in this, they killed great numbers
and threw us into confusion.”</p>

<p>The foremost French battalion of Marcognet’s
column was the 45th of the Line, one of Napoleon’s
favourite corps, recruited in the capital,
and always spoken of by him as “Mes braves
Enfants de Paris.” Said he of them indeed
once, when pointing them out to the Russian
Envoy at the grand review of June 1810:
“Mark those soldiers, Prince: that is my 45th—my
brave children of Paris! If ever cartridges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
are burned between my brother the Emperor of
Russia and me, I will show him the efficiency of
my 45th. It was they who stormed your
Russian batteries at Austerlitz. They are
scamps [“des vauriens”] off duty, but lions on
campaign; you should see their dash, their
intrepidity; above all, their cheerfulness under
fire!” Small men—“ideal voltigeurs” Napoleon
also called the 45th—they stood a poor chance
against the stalwart swordsmen of the Scots
Greys.</p>

    <p>From the picture by R. Andsell, A.R.A., at Royal Hospital, Chelsea.</p>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was they who were to yield up the first of
our British Eagle-trophies of Waterloo. The
prize fell to a non-commissioned officer of the
Greys, Sergeant Charles Ewart, a Kilmarnock
man, who achieved the feat of taking it single-handed.
Ewart, an athletic fellow of splendid
physique and herculean strength, six feet four
in his stockings, and a notable <i lang="fr">sabreur</i>, was
plunging through the struggling press of infantry,
slashing out to right and left, when he
caught sight of the Eagle of the 45th, with its
gorgeous new silken flag, bearing the glittering
inscription in letters of gold—“Austerlitz,
Jena, Friedland, Essling, Wagram.” It was being
hurried away to the rear for safety in the
middle of a small band of devoted men who
surrounded it, and were fighting hard with
their bayonets to keep the British off. Sergeant
Ewart saw that and rode straight for the Eagle-bearer.
Parrying the bayonet-thrusts at him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
as he got up, he cut down the French officer
who carried the Eagle, and then had a fight with
two others. These, first one and then the other,
were killed or disabled by the sergeant, who in
the end carried off the splendid trophy triumphantly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW EWART TOOK THE EAGLE</div>

<p>Ewart himself, in a letter to his father, tells
his own story of the taking of the Eagle:</p>

<p>“He and I had a hard contest for it. He
thrust for my groin; I parried it off and cut him
through the head, after which I was attacked by
one of their lancers, who threw his lance at me,
but missed the mark by my throwing it off
with my sword, at my right side. Then I cut
him from the chin upwards, which went through
his teeth. Next I was attacked by a foot-soldier,
who, after firing at me, charged me
with his bayonet; but he very soon lost the
combat, for I parried it and cut him down
through the head. That finished the contest
for the Eagle.”</p>

<p>Napoleon was watching the progress of the
fight through his glasses. He witnessed the
charge of the Scots Greys—unaware, of course,
that it was his pet “Enfants de Paris” who were
undergoing their fate. “Qu’ils sont terribles
ces chevaux gris!” was the exclamation that,
according to the guide De Coster, fell from
Napoleon’s lips at the sight. The Greys cut
his unlucky 45th to pieces, and had overthrown
the rest of Marcognet’s Division in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
three minutes. “In three minutes,” says a
British officer in the charge, “the column was
totally overthrown and numbers of them taken
prisoners.”</p>

<p>Sabring their way through the remnants of
the 45th, and leaving the prisoners to be secured
by the Highlanders, the Greys then charged the
supporting regiment, the 25th of the Line.
These, “lost in amazement at the suddenness
and wildness of the charge and its terrific effect
on their comrades on the higher ground in front,”
were caught in the act of trying to form square.
Some of them fired a few shots at the dragoons,
but the impetus of the first charge carried the
Greys in among them with a rush, driving in
the foremost ranks and making the rest of
the column in rear roll back and break up.
In panic and despair they threw down their
muskets and, according to a British officer,
“surrendered in crowds.” The Eagle of the 25th,
however, was saved. It was carried safely off
the field, and is now one of the Napoleonic relics
at the Invalides.</p>

<p>Ewart was at once sent to Brussels with the
trophy, and on his arrival carried it through the
crowded streets “amidst the acclamations of
thousands of spectators who saw it.” He was
given an ensigncy in the 3rd Royal Veteran
Battalion in recognition of his exploit. The
sword he used at Waterloo is now among the
treasures of Chelsea Hospital, and Ewart’s old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
regiment bears embroidered on its standard a
French Eagle, with the legend “Waterloo.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHARGE OF THE “ROYALS”</div>

<p>Within a few moments of Sergeant Ewart
capturing the Eagle of the 45th, an officer of the
Royal Dragoons, Captain A.&nbsp;K. Clark (afterwards
Sir A.&nbsp;K. Clark-Kennedy) took, also in hand-to-hand
fight, the other Eagle sent home by Wellington
from Waterloo—that of the 105th of the
Line, the leading regiment of Bourgeois’
Brigade.</p>

<p>The Royals, on the right of the Union Brigade,
came down on the French left column. That, as
yet, had had no enemy in front of it, and was
advancing with cheers and shouts of triumph
across the crest-line of the ridge. It overlapped
and extended beyond the flank of what
had been Picton’s line, and so far had only been
fired at from a distance by artillery and part of
the 95th. Suddenly the French were startled by
the apparition of a mass of cavalry quite near;
coming on within eighty or ninety yards of them—emerging
from the battle-smoke at a gallop.</p>

<p>The sight took them completely by surprise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
The loud shouts of triumph stopped abruptly.
“The head of the column,” describes one of the
Royals, “appeared to be seized with a panic,
gave us a fire which brought down about twenty
men, went instantly about, and endeavoured to
regain the opposite side of the hedges.” They
had just crossed the Wavre road along the slope,
about halfway up.</p>

<p>It was the men of one corps, the 105th of the
Line, who so turned back. They, of all in the
regiments of Napoleon’s army, knew what it
was to be charged by cavalry. They had had
one fearful experience of what cold steel in
strong hands could do, and wanted no second.
They were the same 105th whom Wellington’s
Hanoverian Dragoons, in the pursuit after Salamanca,
had ridden down and slaughtered so
mercilessly. Once more the fearful fate was
about to overtake them—was at hand, was on
them! In the ranks were many veterans who
had served in the 105th in Spain before 1814,
and had rejoined on Napoleon’s return from
Elba. The slaughter after Salamanca was a
grim and horrifying memory in the regiment
that every man shuddered to recall. It all came
back vividly to them now, as the flashing sabres
of the Royal Dragoons burst into view, making
for them across the ridge. The whole regiment
gave back and broke, turning for help to the
supporting 28th in rear.</p>

<p>But they were not able to reach their refuge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
in time. Without drawing rein the Royals
pressed home their charge. They were into the
105th in a moment, cutting them down on all
sides.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW THE SECOND EAGLE WAS TAKEN</div>

<p>In that <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> the Eagle of the 105th met its
fate. Captain Clark-Kennedy himself describes
how that came about—how he came to take the
Eagle. He was in command of the centre
squadron, leading through the thick of the
ill-fated infantrymen.</p>

<p>“I did not see the Eagle and Colour (for there
were two Colours, but only one with an Eagle)
until we had been probably five or six minutes
engaged. It must, I should think, have been
originally about the centre of the column, and
got uncovered from the change of direction.
When I first saw it, it was perhaps about forty
yards to my left, and a little in my front. The
officer who carried it, and his companions, were
moving with their backs towards me, and endeavouring
to force their way through the crowd.</p>

<p>“I gave the order to my squadron, ‘Right
shoulders forward! Attack the Colour!’ leading
direct on the point myself. On reaching
it I ran my sword into the officer’s right side,
a little above the hip-joint. He was a little to
my left side, and he fell to that side, with the
Eagle across my horse’s head. I tried to catch
it with my left hand, but could only touch the
fringe of the flag; and it is probable it would
have fallen to the ground, had it not been prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
by the neck of Corporal Styles’ horse,
who came close up on my left at the instant,
and against which it fell. Corporal Styles was
standard-coverer: his post was immediately
behind me, and his duty to follow wherever
I led.</p>

<p>“When I first saw the Eagle, I gave the order
‘Right shoulders forward! Attack the Colour!’
and on running the officer through the body
I called out twice together, ‘Secure the Colour!
Secure the Colour! It belongs to me!’ This
order was addressed to some men close to me,
of whom Corporal Styles was one.</p>

<p>“On taking up the Eagle I endeavoured to
break the Eagle off the pole, with the intention
of putting it into the breast of my coat, but I
could not break it. Corporal Styles said, ‘Pray,
sir, do not break it,’ on which I replied, ‘Very
well. Carry it to the rear as fast as you can. It
belongs to me!’”</p>

<p>Taking hold of the Eagle, Corporal Styles
turned away. He had a fight to get through
with it, and had, we are told, literally to cut
his way back to safety.</p>

<p>Captain Clark-Kennedy, who received two
wounds and had two horses killed under him,
was given the C.B. He was granted later, as
an augmentation to his family arms, the representation
of a Napoleonic Eagle and flag;
with for crest a “demi-dragoon holding a flag
with an Eagle on it.” Corporal Styles was appointed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
to an ensigncy in the West India Regiment.
The Royal Dragoons wear the device of
a Napoleonic Eagle as collar-badge, and bear
an Eagle embroidered on their standard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHERE ANOTHER FLAG WAS FOUND</div>

<p>As with the 45th, so with the 105th—both
battalions of each regiment lost their colours;
the regimental Eagle and the “fanion” of the
second battalion. The “fanion” of the 105th,
described as “a dark blue silken flag, with on it
the words ‘105me Régiment d’Infanterie de
Ligne,’” came into British possession in a manner
that is not clear. It was not taken in fight
by the Royals. Was it picked up on the field
after the battle by some camp-follower and
sold? Its existence and whereabouts remained
unknown until some twenty-four years afterwards.
As it happened, curiously, General Clark-Kennedy,
as he then was, himself lighted upon
it by chance, hanging in the hall of Sir Walter
Scott’s home at Abbotsford. How it got there,
in spite of all inquiries, the general was unable
to discover.</p>

<p>Two other Eagles, it would appear, had adventures
at Waterloo.</p>

<p>One, according to an unconfirmed story, was
taken and lost by the Inniskillings, who charged
the 54th and 55th of the Line, stationed at the
rear of Bourgeois’ Brigade, just after the Royals
attacked the leading battalion of that column.
A trooper named Penfold claimed to have taken
the Eagle of one of the two regiments. “After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
we charged,” he said, “I saw an Eagle which I
rode up to, and seized hold of it. The man who
bore it would not give it up, and I dragged him
along by it for a considerable distance. Then
the pole broke about the middle, and I carried
off the Eagle. Immediately after that I saw
a comrade, Hassard, in difficulties, and, giving
the Eagle to a young soldier of the Inniskillings,
I went to his aid. The Eagle got dropped and
lost.”</p>

<p>The second of these two Eagles is said to have
been captured by the Blues, the Royal Horse
Guards, and then lost in much the same way.
“A private in the Blues,” records Wellington’s
Supplemental Despatches, “killed a French officer
and took an Eagle; but his own horse being
killed, he could not keep it.” A French officer
also mentions the taking of the Eagle by the
Blues and its recovery.</p>

<p>About the time that the ill-fated 45th of the
Line and the 105th lost their Eagles in front
of Picton’s Division, another Eagle elsewhere
had a narrow escape from capture, being saved
by its colonel’s personal act. That took place
in front of Hougoumont, with the Eagle of the
1st of the Line. The regiment was in Jerome
Bonaparte’s Division in front of Hougoumont,
and had made an attack on the outbuildings
of the château, which the defenders had beaten off.
At the last moment, as the French assault recoiled,
the Eagle-bearer and his two fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
were shot down together. The battalion fell
back, leaving the Eagle lying on the ground in
the open, beside its dead guardians. For the
moment, apparently, the British defenders did
not see the trophy thus left within their reach.
Before they did so Colonel Cubières, of the 1st
of the Line, discovered its loss and saw where it
had fallen. He ran out by himself, picked up
the Eagle, and, escaping harm of any kind, carried
it back to the regiment. According to M.
Thiers, “the English officers checked the fire
of their men while the deed was being performed,
in admiration of his courage”—an interesting
detail in the story if true!</p>

<h3 id="toclink_405"><span class="smcap">The Last Attack and After: The Eagles of the Guard</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">THE EAGLES OF THE GUARD</div>

<p>In the third episode in the story of Waterloo
we strike another note. How the Eagles of the
Guard fared in the closing hour of the battle,
when Napoleon staked his last desperate throw
and lost—that final phase remains to tell.</p>

<p>Fourteen Eagles of the Guard were on the
field. All came safely through the battle and
survived the risks and perils of the night retreat
that followed, to recross the frontier with the
rallied remnants of the stricken host. Only
three, however, are now in existence: one at
the Invalides; the other two in private keeping
in France. The remaining eleven were, some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
of them at any rate, destroyed by the officers
on the final disbanding of the Grand Army,
refusing to give them up to the emissaries of the
Bourbon <i lang="fr">régime</i> sent to receive them for conveyance
to Vincennes, where as many as could
be got hold of among the regimental Eagles
underwent their fate by fire.</p>

<p>Five Eagles went forward in the great last-hope
attack of the Guard against the centre of
Wellington’s position, the overthrow of which
cost Napoleon the battle. They were the Eagles
of the 3rd and 4th Grenadiers of the Guard, and
of three regiments of the Chasseurs of the Guard,
the 1st, 3rd, and 4th. All five are among those
that have disappeared since Waterloo.</p>

<p>Close beside the Eagle of the 3rd Grenadiers
it was that Marshal Ney fought so heroically, as
he led in person the historic grand attack of the
Imperial Guard. His fifth horse was shot under
Ney in the advance, and he then drew his sword
and strode forward on foot alongside the Eagle-bearer.
So he led until the column reeled back
and broke under the sudden attack of the British
Guards across the crest-line of the slope. At
that moment Ney lost his footing, and fell in the
confusion. “He disappeared,” says a French
officer, “just at the moment that the Guard gave
way. But he was up again in a moment, and
with voice and gesture strove his hardest to rally
them.” It was to no purpose. The great
column wavered, swayed, and then fell apart in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
disorder. “Mitraillée, fusillée, reduit à quinze
ou seize cent hommes, la Garde recule!” Ney
was swept off his feet in the retreat, and borne
backwards; carried away in the rush of the
fugitives, struggling helplessly in the crowd.
“Bathed in perspiration, his eyes blazing with
indignation, foaming at the mouth, his uniform
torn open, one of his epaulets cut away by a
sabre-slash, his star of the Legion of Honour
dented by a bullet, bleeding, muddy, heroic,
holding a broken sword in his hand, he shouted
to the men, ‘See how a Marshal of France dies
on the battlefield!’ But it was in vain: he
did not die.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEY’S LAST HEROIC EFFORT</div>

<p>Then Ney, mounting a trooper’s horse, made
for a regiment near, whose men were falling
back in fair order, with their Eagle borne defiantly
in their midst—the 8th of the Line. With
them was a battalion of the 95th, also displaying
their Eagle gallantly as they, too, tried to withdraw
in regular formation. Ney made them
face about, and put himself at their head.
He appealed to them in the words he had used
just before, when trying to rally the Guard:
“Suivez moi, camarades. Je vais vous montrer
comment meurt un Maréchal de France sur le
champ de bataille!” The men turned to face
the enemy, with a shout of “Vive le Maréchal
Ney!” They charged forward towards where
some of the red-coats of Kempt’s and Pack’s
infantry showed themselves in the van of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
pursuers. But at the same instant some horsemen
of a Prussian hussar regiment dashed at
them at a gallop. The sight of the horsemen
was too much for their shattered nerves. They
turned their backs and ran off panic-stricken.
Ney’s last rallied band broke and fled, with cries
of “Sauve qui peut!”</p>

<p>Yet not quite all. A small band of the men
of the 8th kept round their Eagle, and retired in
order, still holding it up. <i lang="fr">Chef de Bataillon</i>
Rullière, of the 95th, snatched the Eagle of that
regiment from its bearer, broke the staff, and
carried off the Eagle concealed under his coat.</p>

<p>Ney’s sixth horse was shot under him as the
men turned. Again getting to his feet he staggered
on in the midst of the crowd of fugitives
until he at last found his way into one of the
rallying squares formed in rear by some of
the survivors of the Guard. There now, beside
the Eagle of the 4th Chasseurs of the Guard,
Ney made his last stand at Waterloo—at bay,
desperate. He fought in the square, “shoulder
to shoulder with the rest, shooting and thrusting
with a musket and bayonet he got hold of,” as
the square slowly made its retreat off the field,
until in the darkness it broke up, and the men
dispersed. The devotion of a mounted officer
who met the marshal on foot, utterly worn out
and by himself, and gave up his horse to him,
enabled Ney in the end to reach a place of safety.</p>

<p>Napoleon was watching the Second Column<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
of the Guard at the moment of its disaster.
How the overwhelming catastrophe burst on his
gaze, abruptly and all unexpectedly, makes one
of the most dramatic of historic scenes. At
that moment Napoleon was about to lead in
person the reserve of the Guard, three battalions
which he had retained near him throughout, to
reinforce the fighting line.</p>

<p>“While they were being marshalled for the
attack—one battalion deployed, with a battalion
in close column on either side—he kept his
glass turned upon the conflict in which he intended
to bear a part.</p>

<p>“Suddenly his hand fell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON IS HORROR-STRICKEN</div>

<p>“‘Mais ils sont mêlée!’ he ejaculated in a
tone of horror, his voice hollow and quavering.
He addressed his aide de camp, Count Flahault,
who was under no illusion as to what troops were
meant. The sun had just set. There was no
radiance to prevent all men seeing what was
going on out there in the north-west.”</p>

<p>Immediately on that followed the general
collapse: the almost instantaneous break up of
the French army all along the line.</p>

<p>“First the trampled corn in rear was sprinkled,
then it was covered, with a confused mass of men
moving south; behind and among them the
sabres of Vivian’s hussars and Vandeleur’s
dragoons rose and fell, hacking and hewing on
every side.</p>

<p>“‘La Garde recule!’ sounded like a sob in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
the motionless ranks of the Old Guard (the three
battalions near Napoleon), and sped with astonishing
swiftness to every part of the field.
‘La Garde recule!’ cried the men of Allix,
Donzelot, and Marcognet, and began to melt
away from the vantage ground they had recently
so nobly won. ‘La Garde recule!’ whispered
Reille’s columns, still unbroken on the left.
Far on the right, Durutte’s battalions, suddenly
confronted by the heads of Ziethen’s columns,
where they had been told to look for Grouchy’s,
caught up the word. Next, the uneasy murmur,
‘Nous sommes trahis!’ was heard—for was
there not treason? Had not General Bourmont
and his staff, and other officers, openly gone over
to the enemy? ‘La Garde recule!’ Oh
fatal cry! soon swelling into one still more
dreadful—last tocsin of the soldier’s agony—‘Sauve
qui peut!’ Papelotte and La Haye
were abandoned, and from the east, as already
from the west, the wreck of the Last Army
rolled towards the Charleroi road.”</p>

<p>The Eagle that was close beside Napoleon at
that most awful moment of his life, as he saw
his Guard break and fall back in confusion, is at
the Invalides now. It is the Eagle of the 2nd
Grenadiers of the Guard; one of the three reserve
battalions that were forming up to go
forward at the moment of the catastrophe.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Napoleon watched the panic begin to spread
over the field for a brief moment. Then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
roused himself to try to meet the impending
crash. First he formed the Guard battalions
nearest him into square. Then he sent off his
last remaining gallopers, in the futile hope that
it might be possible to rally the men of the nearest
divisions to him before they had time to scatter.
But the effort was hopeless: it was beyond
possibility to stem the raging torrent of frantic
soldiers, now in full flight on every side, racing
past in the direction of Jemmapes. The lie that
he had sent round just before the Guard started
on its charge, that Grouchy had arrived, recoiled
on his own head. The panic-stricken soldiers
would not be stopped. “They had been told
that Grouchy had arrived. They had found
instead Ziethen’s terrible Prussians. Now they
would listen to nothing. The fugitives streamed
past, rushing on and bellowing as they went
that they had been betrayed and that all was
lost!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAPOLEON SHELTERS IN A SQUARE</div>

<p>After that Napoleon rode into the nearest
square, and took shelter in its midst. It was
that of the Second Battalion of the 2nd Chasseurs
of the Guard. The square moved off at once
towards La Belle Alliance, and, turning there
into the Charleroi road, took its way back towards
Rossomme, half a mile in rear, where the
two battalions of the 1st and 2nd Grenadiers
of the Old Guard had remained all day.</p>

<p>At Rossomme Napoleon passed to the square
of the First Battalion of the 1st Grenadiers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
Old Guard. The two battalions of the Guard
there had already formed in squares of their
own accord, with their Eagles held on high in
their midst. They were joined by the 1st
Chasseurs of the Guard, coming up from Caillou,
a short distance in rear. The three squares held
their ground firmly, beating off the headmost of
the Prussian attacks. They remained halted
until, on some of the Prussian artillery nearing
the place, Napoleon himself gave the order to
move away in retreat.</p>

<p>At a slow step, the drums rolling out the
stately “Grenadier’s March,” sullen and defiant,
the Old Guard, with Napoleon in the midst of
the square of the 1st Grenadiers, set forth on
their last journey. Their Eagle was still borne
on high in their midst—close beside Napoleon.
It is the Eagle that is now treasured in Paris by
the descendants of General Petit, the commander
of the Grenadiers at Waterloo—the Eagle of the
Adieu of Fontainebleau; the same Eagle that
led the Guard at Austerlitz and Jena, at Eylau
and Friedland, at Wagram, and throughout all
the horrors of the retreat from Moscow. It
escorted Napoleon off the field after Waterloo.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD GUARD MARCH AWAY</div>

<p>The Grenadiers of the Guard escorted Napoleon
for four miles from the battlefield, beating
back repeated efforts that were made by Prussian
cavalry to break up their ranks. To
maintain their formation to the last was their
only hope of safety; and terrible were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
measures they took to safeguard themselves
and keep their ranks intact. Friend or foe who
attempted to get in among them was mercilessly
shot down. “Nous tirons,” describes General
Petit, “sur tout ce qui presentaient, amis et
ennemis, de peur de laisser entrer les uns
avec les autres.” They took their way along
the Charleroi road; the 2nd Grenadiers marching
on the <i lang="fr">chaussée</i> itself, the 1st Grenadiers to the
left of the road. With marvellous calmness and
cool courage did the veterans proceed on their
way. “Every few minutes they stopped to
rectify the alignment of the faces of the square,
and to keep off pursuit by means of rapid and
well-sustained musketry.”</p>

<p>Erckmann-Chatrian’s soldier of the 25th, who
was amongst the fugitives streaming across
country on either side of the high-road, tells
how he heard from afar the stately drum-beat
of their march. “In the distance <i lang="fr">La Grenadière</i>
sounded like an alarm-bell in the midst of a
conflagration. Yet, indeed, this was much more
terrible—it was the last drum-beat of France!
This rolling of the drums of the Old Guard
sounding forth in the midst of disaster had in it
something infinitely pathetic as well as terrible.”</p>

<p>And of the scene with Napoleon in the square
of the Grenadiers as it tramped its way along,
we have this from Thiers: “With sombre but
calm countenance, he rode in the centre of the
square, his far-seeing glance as it were probing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
futurity and realising that more than a battle
had been lost that day. He only interrupted
his gloomy meditations to inquire now and again
for his lieutenants, some of whom were among
the wounded near him. The soldiers all round
seemed stupefied by the disaster. The men
moved stolidly on, almost without a word to one
another. Napoleon alone seemed to be able to
speak; occasionally addressing a few words to
the Major-General (Soult), or to his brother
Jerome, who rode beside him. Now and again,
when harassed by the Prussian squadrons, the
square would halt, and the side that was attacked
fired on the assailants, after which the sad and
silent march was resumed.”</p>

<p>Throughout the march, keeping their position
at a little distance from the squares of the Grenadiers,
rode the Horse-Grenadiers and the Mounted
Chasseurs of the Guard. One of the finest displays
of soldierly endurance ever made, perhaps,
was that given by the Horse-Grenadiers of the
Guard as the magnificent regiment left the field,
“moving at a walk, in close columns and in
perfect order; as if disdaining to allow itself
to be contaminated by the confusion that prevailed
around it.” So describes a British officer
who saw them ride away. They beat off all attacks
and kept steadily and compactly together.
“They literally walked from the field in the most
orderly manner, moving majestically along, with
their Eagle in their midst, as though merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
marching to take up their ground for a field-day.”
This, further, is what a British officer of
Light Dragoons, who came up with them in the
pursuit, says of their heroic demeanour: “Seeing
the men of our brigade approach, they halted,
formed line, and fired a volley—a rare thing for
dragoons—and waited a few minutes, as much
as to say, ‘We are ready to receive your charge
if you are so disposed’; then finding we did not
advance, they again continued their slow retreat.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A FAMOUS EAGLE NOW IN FRANCE</div>

<p>The Eagle of the Horse-Grenadiers has disappeared
since Waterloo: that of the Mounted
Chasseurs of the Guard is in existence, in France,
in the custody of a member of the Bonaparte
family. It was preserved by General Lefebvre-Desnouettes,
Colonel-in-Chief of the regiment,
who commanded the Chasseurs at Waterloo.
Carried in safety to France, the Eagle was then
taken to America, when the General, on whose
head a price had been placed, escaped across the
Atlantic in the autumn of 1815. He presented
it later to Joseph Bonaparte, in the possession
of whose representatives the Eagle is now. It
still bears attached to the staff the green silk
guidon-shaped flag, inscribed “Chasseurs de la
Garde,” and embroidered with gold and silver
laurel-leaves, which it bore at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Napoleon quitted the square of Grenadiers
about two miles from Jemmapes. By that time
the Prussians had ceased their attacks on the
Guard for easier prey elsewhere. He rode on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
at a little distance ahead; the battalions of the
Guard at the same time re-forming into columns
of march. They kept with the Emperor until
the neighbourhood of Jemmapes was reached.
There Napoleon and Soult and the others quitted
the road, betaking themselves across the fields
to make their way as best they could to Charleroi,
whence Napoleon was able to continue his flight
in a post-chaise.</p>

<p>Yet another of the Waterloo Eagles of the
Guard with a story to be told of it was that of
the 2nd Chasseurs—one of the Eagles that have
now disappeared. How the Eagle was saved
from capture, and finally brought through to
safety, recalls a remarkable and dramatic
incident of the battle.</p>

<p>The 2nd Chasseurs was one of the twelve
battalions of the Young Guard detached by
Napoleon late in the afternoon to assist General
Lobau and the Sixth Army Corps to keep off
the Prussian flank attack. Between them they
saved the army from an even worse catastrophe
than that which actually befell Napoleon
at Waterloo—from having to surrender. For
nearly an hour after the rout had become general,
the Sixth Corps, and the battalions of the Young
Guard assisting it, by their heroic resistance,
prevented the Prussians from breaking in on the
only line of retreat open to the defeated army,
and enabled Napoleon to get clear away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO SAVE THE REST OF THE ARMY</div>

<p>“Lobau,” to quote the words of a modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
military writer, “recognised to the full that he
alone interposed between the Prussians and the
French line of retreat. If he failed, retreat would
be cut off, and the army taken in rear as well as
in front and flank; not a man would get away.
The fate of the Army, the Emperor, of France,
rested on Lobau at the supreme moment, and
splendidly he did his duty. Dusk had given way
to dark, only illuminated by the blazing ruins of
Planchenoit, before Lobau retired, but by that
time the rear of the flying army had cleared the
point of peril, and comparative safety was assured.
Still steady, and in good order, he took post on
the high-road to close the line of flight and block
pursuit, and the gallant remnant of the Sixth
Corps and the Young Guard had to bear the full
fury of the combined advance of the enemy.
Nothing at Waterloo can surpass for coolness,
courage, and determination the heroic resistance
of Lobau.”</p>

<p>It was in the village of Planchenoit that the
2nd Chasseurs fought side by side with the other
battalions of the Guard in that quarter under
the leadership of General Pelet, to whom Napoleon
had specially entrusted the defence of the post.
Planchenoit was defended foot by foot at the
point of the bayonet against ever-increasing
numbers of the Prussians. The 2nd Chasseurs
were the last troops of all to quit, after contesting
the village house by house, cottage by
cottage, fighting the Prussians man to man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
among the bushes and walls of the gardens,
and finally in the churchyard, where they made
their last stand at bay, desperately combating
among the tombstones. Fresh Prussians kept
coming up to join in the attack, but the 2nd
Chasseurs, their Eagle defiantly displayed in the
midst of the battling throng, resisted stubbornly.
When at the last they drew off, the whole of
Planchenoit was a mass of flames, blazing from
end to end.</p>

<p>There remained a rough half-mile of open
ground before they could get to the Charleroi
road—the line of retreat along which, by that
time, a large proportion of the fugitives from the
main army had got away. The 2nd Chasseurs,
in rear of all, as they left their last shelter in
Planchenoit and were beyond the churchyard
walls, were swept down on by a furious rush of
Prussian cavalry, and half the regiment was
cut to pieces. The moon was rising by that
time, and the Prussians had sufficient light for
their deadly work.</p>

<p>The survivors, broken up, and thrown in
irremediable disorder, could after that only run
for their lives. But they still bore their Eagle
among them. It was draped under a black cloth.
Somebody, in some house in the village, as they
were falling back to the churchyard, had, it
would appear, caught up a strip of crape or black
cloth, and hastily wrapped it round the
Eagle to conceal it in that way from hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
eyes. The Eagle-bearer refused to break the
Eagle from the staff, and hide it under his
coat, as others had done elsewhere with other
Eagles.</p>

<p>With the Eagle so covered, a small party of
devoted soldiers were accompanying their
standard as the survivors of the Prussian
charge hastened towards the Charleroi road,
when there came yet another attack from the
Prussian horse, who charged among them and
trampled them down as the troopers slashed
mercilessly at the fugitives. At that moment
the Eagle and its guardians found themselves
near the General. They were isolated and cut
off in the midst of the wild <i lang="fr">mêlée</i>. Pelet caught
sight of them, desperately striving to protect
the Eagle-bearer, who was frantically clutching
at the Eagle-staff as he held on to it and tried
to get through.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“SAVE YOUR EAGLE OR DIE ROUND IT!”</div>

<p>Pelet made for the group, shouting at the top
of his voice: “Rally, Chasseurs! Rally on me!
Save your Eagle or die round it!” (“A moi,
Chasseurs! A moi! Sauvons l’Aigle ou mourons
autour d’elle!”)</p>

<p>In the midst of the frenzied tumult his cry for
help was somehow heard by the men ahead.
They turned back in their flight and fought their
way to the threatened Eagle. Others pressed
round to join them, until by degrees was formed
a compact body between two and three hundred
in number, who with their bayonets kept the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
cavalry back as they fought their way towards
the high-road step by step.</p>

<p>More than once they had to halt and face
about, as the Prussian horsemen in their repeated
attempts to capture the Eagle circled
round them, and dashed in at them again and
again, but, “forming what is usually termed a
rallying square, and lowering their bayonets,
they succeeded in repulsing the charges of the
cavalry.” At one point in the retreat “some
guns were brought to bear upon them, and
subsequently a brisk fire of musketry; but
notwithstanding the awful sacrifice which was
thus offered up in defence of their precious
charge, they succeeded in reaching the main
line of retreat, and saved alike the Eagle and
the Honour of the Regiment.”</p>

<p>The Eagles of the Guard all came safely
through the turmoil and horrors of the night of
the rout after Waterloo. And—it seems incredible,
but the fact is vouched for by several
officers—so did the other Eagles of the army.
All at Waterloo, it is declared, were brought
back to France, except the two taken from the
ill-fated 45th and the 105th of the Line by the
Scots Greys and the Royals. Those two only
remained as trophies in the hands of the victors.
General Charras, whose good faith we have no
right to impugn, declares the fact in explicit
language, and another officer relates how, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
day after the battle, when the rallied remains
of the army assembled at Phillippeville and
Maubeuge, “the soldiers wept tears of joy at
learning how many of their Eagles had been
saved.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“MAKE WAY FOR THE EAGLE!”</div>

<p>Says General Charras, describing how the
Eagles were saved that night: “Two standards
had been lost on the battlefield. There was
none other lost. In the crowd of disbanded
horsemen and foot-soldiers, marching and running
pell-mell, some still armed, others having
thrown away or broken their sabres and guns
under the impulse of rage, of despair, of terror,
there were to be seen, by the pale light of the
moon, little groups of officers of every grade,
and of soldiers, spontaneously collected round the
standard of each regiment, and advancing sabre
in hand, bayonet on the gun, resolute and imperturbable
in the midst of the general disorder.
‘Place au drapeau!’ cried they when the rout
arrested their march, and this cry always sufficed
to cause the very men who had become deaf to
every word of command and to all discipline
to stand aside before them and open a passage.
They had often to endure peril, they had often
to repulse the enemy’s attacks, but they saved
their conquered flags from the attempts and
hands of the conqueror.”</p>

<p>Grouchy also saved all his Eagles—although
one had its adventures in the attack on Wavre, and
was nearly lost to the Prussians. The story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
this time is not exactly creditable to some of
those concerned; but the regiment in question,
it must be said, had but few old soldiers in its
ranks, having been made up almost entirely of
recently levied and half-trained conscripts. Also,
it had just previously been very roughly handled
by the Prussians on the battlefield of Ligny.
There, indeed, it had been charged by cavalry,
and had suffered severely. The unfortunate
regiment was the 70th of the Line.</p>

<p>In Grouchy’s fighting at Wavre they were in
Vandamme’s Division, which had orders to carry
the bridge over the Dyle and storm the town,
held by the Prussians in considerable force. To
give the 70th a chance of getting their revenge
for Ligny, and winning back the old good name
of the regiment, Vandamme specially chose them
for the post of honour in the attack; appointing
the 70th to lead the van in the preliminary
storming of the bridge. They led the attack,
dashing forward bravely enough at the outset,
and got halfway across. Then they stopped
short, their ranks decimated by the furious
fire with which the Prussians received them from
the houses on the opposite bank, hesitated,
went on a few paces, stopped again, and finally
ran back in panic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAVED BY ANOTHER REGIMENT</div>

<p>The sight of the sudden rout maddened their
leader, Colonel Maury. Stooping from his charger,
he snatched hold of the Eagle from its bearer,
and held it up before the men. “What! you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
scoundrels! You dishonoured me two days
ago; you are again disgracing me to-day!
Forward! Follow me!” (“Comment, canaille!
Vous m’avez deshonoré avant-hier, et vous
recidiviez aujourdhui! En avant! Suivez
moi!”) Brandishing the Eagle the colonel
turned his horse to ride back across the bridge.
The drums beat the charge: the regiment followed.
But all was to no purpose. As fate
willed it, the gallant colonel fell, shot dead before
he could get across, and at the sight of his fall
panic again seized the regiment. They ran
wildly back again, leaving the dead colonel’s
body and the Eagle lying halfway across the
bridge. The Eagle was rescued and brought
back by the men of another regiment. Had it
not been for the sudden rush forward of the
leading company of the 22nd of the Line, the
regiment supporting the 70th in the attack, the
Eagle would have been taken. Several Prussian
soldiers had indeed already run forward to pick
it up, and their leader was in the act of doing so
when the foremost of the rescuers arrived, beat
back the Prussians, and recovered the fallen
Eagle.</p>

<p>The failure of this one regiment at Wavre is
the only recorded instance of bad behaviour
before the enemy in the Waterloo campaign.
And for it too, in view of the composition of the
regiment in question, some allowance may surely
be made.</p>

<h3 id="toclink_424"><span class="smcap">The Eagles announce Victory to London</span></h3>

<p>The last of the four episodes is supplemental:
the story of how Wellington’s Eagle-trophies
themselves first announced Waterloo to London.</p>

<p>The two Eagles were sent to England immediately
after the battle, together with Wellington’s
Waterloo despatch, by Major the Hon. Henry
Percy, of the 11th Light Dragoons, who was
almost the only member of Wellington’s staff
who went through the battle unwounded. He
arrived in London, displaying the Eagles from
his post-chaise as he travelled through the streets,
on the stroke of eleven o’clock on the night of
Wednesday, June 21.</p>

<p>Up to then not a word had come from Wellington:
not a word of reliable news as to what
had happened had reached England. Rumours
of an early check to the French had arrived,
from unofficial sources, during the previous day,
but nothing more had been heard, and all London
was on tenterhooks of suspense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST RUMOURS IN LONDON</div>

<p>The battle was fought on Sunday the 18th.
But no news of it, or in regard to it, of any
kind reached England during either Monday or
Tuesday. There was no intelligence from the seat
of war at all. On the Wednesday morning the
<i>Times</i> announced vaguely that Napoleon had
struck the first blow unsuccessfully. A Mr. Sutton,
of Colchester, it said, the owner of packet-boats
running between Harwich and Ostend, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
forwarded a message to the effect that there
had been fighting on the 15th and 16th and
skirmishing on the 17th, and that a fresh battle
was beginning on the morning of the 18th. His
informant at Brussels had sent that news. There
was no more news until Wednesday afternoon,
when the <i>Sun</i> came out with a special edition
stating that the Government had received no despatches,
but that “a gentleman who left Ghent
on Monday, and two others from Brussels, brought
word that Sunday’s battle had been successful.”
All London was in the streets until between ten
and eleven that night, in a state of eager expectation;
but repeated inquiries at the Horse
Guards, at the War Office, and at the Mansion
House only met with the answer—“No news
yet.”</p>

<p>It was just as the crowds were dispersing,
tired of waiting, and taking it as certain that
nothing could be known until the morning, as
the clocks were on the stroke of eleven, that
Major Percy arrived in London.</p>

<p>“He left the Duchess of Richmond’s ball,”
says his niece, Lady Bagot, in whose words the
story may best be told, “on the night before the
battle, and had no time to change his dress,
or even his shoes, before going into action.
When he received orders to go to England with
the despatches, he posted to Antwerp, and there
took the first sailing boat he could find to convey
him to Dover, where he landed in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
He found that a report of the victory had preceded
him there. The Rothschilds had chartered
a fast sloop to lie off Antwerp, and bring
the first news of the battle to the English shore—news
which was to be used for Stock Exchange
purposes.</p>

<p>“My uncle’s confirmation of the rumour of a
great victory was received with the greatest
relief and enthusiasm. At that time the hotel-keeper
at Dover, a certain Mr. Wright, had the
monopoly of the posting arrangements between
that port and London. He immediately placed
his best horses at my uncle’s disposal, and despatched
an express to order fresh relays all along
the road. Besides the despatches my uncle
took the two captured Eagles of the Imperial
Guard with him. These, being too large to go
into the carriage, were placed so as to stick out
of the windows, one on each side. In this manner
he drove straight to the Horse Guards,
where he learnt that the Commander-in-Chief,
at that time the Duke of York, was dining out.
He next proceeded to Lord Castlereagh’s, and
was told that he and the Duke of York were
both dining with a lady in St. James’s Square.
To this house he drove, and there learnt that the
Prince Regent was also of the dinner-party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESENTED TO THE PRINCE REGENT</div>

<p>“Requesting to be shown immediately into
the dining-room, he entered that apartment
bearing the despatches and the Eagles with him.
He was covered with dust and mud, and, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
unwounded himself, bore the marks of battle
upon his coat. The dessert was being placed
upon the table when he entered, and as soon as
the Prince Regent saw him he commanded the
ladies to leave the room. The Prince Regent
then held out his hand, saying, ‘Welcome,
Colonel Percy!’ ‘Go down on one knee,’ said
the Duke of York to my uncle, ‘and kiss hands
for the step you have obtained.’ Before the
despatch could be read, my uncle was besieged
with inquiries of various prominent officers
engaged, and had to answer ‘Dead’ or ‘Severely
wounded’ so often that the Prince Regent burst
into tears. The Duke of York, though greatly
moved, was more composed.</p>

<p>“By this time my uncle was exhausted from
fatigue, and begged the Prince’s permission to
go to his father’s house in Portman Square.
The crowd was so great in St. James’s Square,
that he had the greatest difficulty in getting
through it and reaching my grandfather’s house,
which was soon surrounded by anxious multitudes
begging for news of relations and friends.
My uncle told them that the victory was complete,
but that the number killed and wounded
was very large. He told them that he would
answer more questions next morning.”</p>

<p>The Eagles themselves in fact announced the
victory in London. People in the streets saw
the chaise as it passed on its way with its horses
at a gallop, racing at full speed along the Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
Kent Road, across Westminster Bridge, and
through Parliament Street to Whitehall, “the
gleaming lamps showing a French Eagle and
the French flags projecting from each window.”</p>

<p>The news spread like wild-fire, and before
Colonel Percy could reach the house where the
Prince Regent was dining—Mrs. Boehm’s, in
St. James’s Square—South London was
flocking over Westminster Bridge to Whitehall.
The West End heard the news immediately
afterwards, and everybody hurried out again
into the streets.</p>

<p>It became quickly known where the chaise
had gone after leaving the Horse Guards, and
promptly an ever-increasing crowd hurried off
there. Before the despatch had been read an
enormous mass of people had assembled in St.
James’s Square, outside the house. They were
in time to hear the cheering by the company inside
the house that greeted the reading of the
despatch; the cheers were instantly echoed back,
accompanied by an outburst of vociferous shouting
followed by a tremendous chorus of “God
save the King!” The windows of the dining-room
were open, and a moment later the two
Eagles with their tricolor flags were thrust
through. They were held up, with candles at
either side, to show them plainly, so that all
might know that the victory had been decisive.</p>

<p>“For a few minutes dustmen’s bells and
watchmen’s rattles were sprung all over London.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
Liquor was produced at many a street-corner,
and toasts were drunk to Wellington and confusion
to Bonaparte.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW PARIS HEARD THE NEWS</div>

<p>The closing scene took place on Thursday,
January 18, 1816—on the “General Thanksgiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
Day for the Restoration of Peace.” The
two Eagles were on that day publicly paraded
at the Horse Guards and laid up in the Chapel
Royal, Whitehall, with ceremonies similar to
those that attended the reception of the Barrosa
and Salamanca trophies. Again the battalions
of the Brigade of Guards in England, with their
bands “in State clothing,” turned out to take
part in the display, the Eagles, as before, being
made to march round the square and do formal
obeisance to the British flag by being prostrated
in the dust before the Colour of the King’s
Guard of the day, at which sight, as on the
former occasions, both the troops and the crowd
of spectators “instantaneously gave three loud
huzzas with the most enthusiastic feeling.”
The Duke of York, as Commander-in-Chief, presided
this time at the parade. Two sergeants
of the Grenadier and Third Guards who had been
wounded at Waterloo were selected to carry the
Eagles; escorted by a picked company of eighty-four
officers and men “drawn from among the
heroic defenders of Hougoumont on the field of
battle.” Lifeguardsmen and Blues just arrived
from the Army of Occupation, in France, assisted
the Foot Guards on parade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE CHAPEL ROYAL, WHITEHALL</div>

<p>The escort entered the Chapel Royal by
the two doors in equal divisions, the band playing
and marching up to the steps of the Communion
Table, where they filed off to right and
left. As soon as the band had ceased, the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
sergeants bearing the Eagles approached the
Altar and fixed upon it their consecrated banners.
Both the Chaplain-General to the Forces (Archdeacon
Owen) and the Bishop of London, with
two Royal Chaplains (“the Rev. Mr. Jones and
the Rev. Mr. Howlett”), officiated in the service;
the Bishop preaching a special sermon, with for
his text Psalm xx. verses 7 and 8:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Some trust in chariots and some in horses:
but we will remember the name of the Lord
our God.</em></p>

<p>“<em>They are brought down and fallen: but
we are risen and stand upright.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>“After the customary blessing, the band
played ‘God save the King!’ the whole congregation
standing. Among those who attended were
a considerable number of persons of fashion and
distinction in public life, the Dukes of Gloucester
and York, and the Earl of Liverpool, and several
officers of the Army and Navy, with many
elegant and distinguished females.”</p>

<span class="subhead">AFTER THE DOWNFALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> remnant of the Waterloo army, as mustered
and officially reported to Paris on July 1,
1815, after it had been withdrawn by convention
with the Allies beyond the Loire, numbered some
23,000 of all arms.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> The soldiers had their
Eagles with them. The Eagles were still the
standards of the army, although all was over with
Napoleon, and he had set out on his flight from
Malmaison to the coast near Rochfort—to find
the <i>Bellerophon</i> awaiting him there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRESENTED AFTER WATERLOO</div>

<p>The last occasion on which an Eagle of Napoleon’s
Army had its part on parade was one day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
near the Loire, with a regiment not at Waterloo.
It was when the news of Napoleon’s abdication
reached its colonel. He was Colonel Bugeaud
of the 14th of the Line, in after years the famous
Marshal who gained Algeria for France. As it
happened, the 14th had not long received their
Eagle from the “<i lang="fr">Champ de Mai</i>.” It had been
brought by the deputation of the regiment sent
to Paris to receive it at the hands of the Emperor,
but had not yet been formally presented on
parade, owing to the regiment being on the
march from the south-eastern frontier of France.
The 14th joined the rallied remnants of the
Waterloo army to the south of the Loire, and
there Colonel Bugeaud made the presentation
of the Eagle. For the occasion he made use of
the Napoleonic formula of address at such
ceremonies, but with a variation to suit the
altered situation. He took the opportunity to
remind the regiment that, if the Chief had fallen,
they yet owed allegiance to their country.
“Soldiers of the 14th,” began the colonel, “here
is your Eagle. It is in the name of the nation
that I present it to you. If the Emperor, as it is
stated, is no longer our Sovereign, France remains.
It is France who confides this Eagle to
you as your standard; it is ever to be your
talisman of victory. Swear that as long as a
soldier of the 14th exists no enemy’s hand shall
touch it!” “We swear it!” responded the
soldiers all together, and then the officers stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
forward in front of the ranks, waving their
swords and again shouting, “We swear it!”</p>

<p>The end for the Eagles of Napoleon came on
August 3, 1815. On that day the Ministerial
decree was promulgated, abolishing them and
the tricolor flag, and disbanding the entire
Army. The white Bourbon flag was restored
once more, with a new form of Army organisation,
which substituted “Departmental Legions”
in the place of regiments. As in the year before,
it was notified that all Eagles were to be sent to
the Artillery dépôt at Vincennes for destruction
there, according to law—the metal of the Eagles
to be melted down, their silken tricolor flags
to be burned.</p>

<p>The date of the final disbandment was fixed
for September 30, and in almost every case
there was a pathetic scene when the hour came
for the soldiers to take their last farewell of
their Eagles. “On the day of the disbandment,”
describes one officer, speaking of his own regiment,
“we all paraded, and the roll was called
for the last time. Then the Eagle was passed
solemnly down along the line, the band playing
a funeral march. The officers and soldiers, all
in tears, after saluting it, embraced and kissed
the Eagle. It was then escorted back to the
colonel’s quarters to be packed up in a box and
forwarded, according to the official instructions,
by carrier to the Ministry of War, thence to go
to Vincennes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE DAY OF THE LAST PARADE</div>

<p>In a few cases, where the senior officers knew
that they had nothing to hope for in the way of
consideration from the new <i lang="fr">régime</i>, the Eagles
were publicly broken up at the last parade by
the colonels themselves, with a blacksmith’s
hammer or pioneer’s hatchet, and the silken
tricolor flags cut to pieces, after which the metal
fragments, together with the shreds of the flags,
were distributed as keepsakes among officers
and men. That being done, all silently dispersed,
never to reassemble. In some other cases, as
had happened a twelvemonth previously, the
Eagles disappeared before the last parade—the
officers in the various regiments having
arranged for one of themselves to retain the
Eagle of the corps privately, either by agreement
or after drawing lots.</p>

<p>It was in this way that what Napoleonic
Eagles and flags are now at the Invalides came
to be there. They were kept hidden by their
possessors until after the Revolution of July,
1830, and then, on the formation of the present
collection of standards and trophies being officially
sanctioned, most of those at present exhibited
were brought to light and presented,
either by those who had been treasuring them
in secret, or by their heirs and families.</p>

<p>Three Waterloo Eagles are at the Invalides:
those of the 2nd Grenadiers of the Guard, and
of the 25th and 26th of the Line; these last two
of the regiments in the columns charged by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
Scots Greys and the Royals. In addition to the
Eagles, there are at the Invalides several standards
that saw service on the battlefield under Napoleon
and survived the vicissitudes of war: seven
flags of infantry, and as many of artillery, one
cuirassier standard, and five other cavalry standards.
Most of these originally bore Eagles on
their staves, but those Eagles are now wanting.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a> “The Eagle for each standard,” said Napoleon, going into
details with Berthier, “must be made ‘strong and light’—‘<i lang="fr">Il
convient de la rendre à la fois solide et légère.</i>’” “An Eagle
looking to its left, with wings half expanded, and with its talons
grasping a thunderbolt, as in the old Roman standard,” was the
approved design: the bird measuring eight inches from head
to feet, and in the spread of its wings from tip to tip, nine and
a half inches. Below the thunderbolt, as base and support,
was a tablet of brass, three inches square; bearing in raised
figures the number of the regiment. The weight of the whole—the
Eagle was to be of copper, gilded over—was just three and
a half pounds avoirdupois, and a stout oaken staff was provided,
eight feet long and painted <i lang="fr">bleu impérial</i>, to which the
silken regimental colour was attached; the flag being thirty-five
inches along the staff and thirty-three lengthwise, in the fly.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">3</a> All armies, as a fact, owe to Napoleon the introduction of
the practice of inscribing on the colours of a regiment the names
of battles in which that regiment has won honour; nowadays
an essential feature of the war-flags of all nations. It originated
after Napoleon’s first campaign as General Bonaparte, at the
head of the Army of Italy; and, together with the inscriptions
of quotations of passages from his despatches, was introduced
by him as a device to aid in developing military spirit and a
sense of <i lang="fr">esprit de corps</i> among the soldiers. The Directory
promptly censured the innovating young general for acting
without having first referred the matter to Paris. They sent
orders that all such inscriptions were to be forthwith deleted
from the flags. Napoleon, however, refused to obey; and the
regiments of his Army supported him. One and all protested
against the removal of their titles to fame, the first appearance
of which on their flags had been hailed with enthusiasm. In the
result the Directory deemed it advisable to accept the situation;
and after that, in turn, the flags of the regiments of the other
Republican armies elsewhere were authorised to display similar
decorations of their own. The practice in due course was
adopted in the other armies of Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a> The sending of an invitation to the Pope had been finally

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a> One of the Eagles so presented by Napoleon on that afternoon
is now at Madrid. It is a trophy that is absolutely unique.
Upwards of a hundred and thirty of Napoleon’s Eagles, the
spoils of war, now decorate cathedrals, chapels, and arsenals in
the capitals of Europe; but there is only one French naval
Eagle now in existence, the trophy at Madrid; the Eagle of a
line-of-battleship named the <i>Atlas</i>.</p>

<p>Every French line-of-battleship was represented on the Champ
de Mars and received its Eagle. “Tous les vaisseaux,” to quote
the words of M. Le Brun, in his <cite lang="fr">Guerres Maritimes de France</cite>,
“étaient gratifiés d’une aigle et d’un drapeau à leur nom, donnés
par l’Empereur à son couronnement, ou avaient assisté et prêté
serment des députations du port et de l’Armée Navale; chaque
vaisseau avait envoyé sa députation composée de trois officiers,
trois officiers mariners, et quatre gabiers ou matelots.”</p>

<p>The Eagle of the <i>Atlas</i> was received on the Field of Mars by
the ship’s deputation of three officers, three warrant officers, and
four seamen, sent from Toulon, where the <i>Atlas</i> then was in
harbour with Admiral Villeneuve’s fleet, which Nelson was
watching. The <i>Atlas</i> crossed the Atlantic in the Toulon fleet
with Nelson in pursuit, returned to Europe, fought in the indecisive
battle off Cape Finisterre in July 1805, and was so
shattered in the fight, in which the ship only just escaped capture,
that she was left behind for repairs at Ferrol when Villeneuve
put to sea finally, to meet his fate at Trafalgar. The <i>Atlas</i> had
to remain there and fell into the hands of the Spaniards in 1808,
at the time of the national uprising against Napoleon. Thus
the naval Eagle passed into Spanish possession.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Atlas</i> were taken by surprise, while the ship
was in dock at Ferrol, by the Spanish regiment of Navarre in
garrison there when the news of the Rising of May 2 at Madrid
reached Galicia. They were trapped and pounced down upon.
The ship was seized by a sudden assault, the officers and men
being made prisoners to the provincial Junta, before they had a
chance of concealing or making away with their Eagle.</p>

<p>In other cases elsewhere, undoubtedly, the naval Eagles were
somehow disposed of surreptitiously. It is very remarkable
that not a single French naval Eagle came into British hands on
board the thirty odd ships of the line which we captured between
1805 and 1814 during the war with Napoleon. At Trafalgar,
according to a French officer on board the French flagship, the
<i>Bucentaure</i>, they had one. Describing the approach of the
<i>Victory</i>, at the outset of the battle, says the officer: “A collision
appeared inevitable. At that moment Villeneuve seized the
Eagle of the <i>Bucentaure</i> and displayed it to the sailors who surrounded
him. ‘My friends,’ he called out, ‘I am going to
throw this on board the English ship! We will go and fetch
it back or die!’ (‘Mes amis, je vais la jetter à bord du vaisseau
Anglais! Nous irons la reprendre ou mourir!’) Our seamen
responded to these noble words by their acclamations.” Admiral
Villeneuve, all the same, did not throw any Eagle on board the
<i>Victory</i>; nor was one found in the <i>Bucentaure</i> during the forty-eight
hours that the ship was in our possession after the battle,
previous to her wreck in the storm at the entrance to Cadiz
harbour. None too were found on board any of Nelson’s other
prizes. As to that, also, what was done with, or became of, the
Eagles of the five battalions serving as marines in the French
fleet at Trafalgar, officers and men of which were taken prisoners
by us—those of the 2nd of the Line, the 16th, 67th, 70th, and
79th?</p>

<p>At the Field of Mars all eyes were on the six hundred and
fifty officers and men of the Naval Brigade as they marched round
the arena to receive their Eagles. Soldiers everybody was
familiar with. There was nothing particular about them which
had not been seen before. But a French sailor was not often seen
away from his port; and to Paris man-of-war’s men were things
quite new and strange. And, besides, were they not “nos braves
marins,” who were going to clear the way for the “Invasion
Flotilla” and the “Army of England”; to strike the blow that
should sweep from the path of the Emperor “ce terrible Nelson!”
One and all gazed in wonder at the sailors: the captains in their
long, swallow-tailed blue coatees barred with gold lace, white
breeches, and high top-boots; the sprightly “<i lang="fr">aspirants</i>,” or
midshipmen, in cut-away jackets and little round hats with
turned-up brims; the showy “Marins de la Garde,” wearing
broad-topped shakos edged with yellow braid, over which tall
red tufts nodded, red-cuffed and yellow-braided blue jackets,
and blue trousers striped with yellow; the other sailors of the
fleet in massed squads, in shiny black flat-brimmed hats, blue
jackets studded with brass buttons, red waistcoats, red, white,
and blue striped pantaloons, wide in the leg, “a l’Anglaise,” and
shoes with round steel buckles. Such a sight the good people
of Paris had never witnessed before, and they gazed at it rapturously
with all their eyes, and shouted their loudest “Vive la
Marine!”</p>

<p>There was too, in addition to the sailors, one Eagle deputation
the strange appearance of which attracted special curiosity and
interest that afternoon. Everybody gazed in wonder at a
group of strapping-looking foreigners of all ages who marched
along by themselves, got up as light infantrymen, with green
tufted shakos and bright green uniforms. They belonged to
one of the Emperor’s newest creations; and were the Eagle
escort of Napoleon’s “Irish Legion.” They had come to the
Field of Mars to receive the only Eagle that Napoleon ever
gave to a foreign regiment in his service, with a flag designed
specially for them, of “Irish Green,” as it was described, of
silk, fringed with gold cord, inscribed on one side in letters
on gold: “Napoléon, Empereur des Français, à la Legion
Irlandaise,” and bearing on the other a golden harp, uncrowned,
and the words “L’Indépendance d’Irlande.” Two ex-patriated
men of good Irish family, refugees escaped from the penalty
of treason under English law for their part in the Rising
of ’98, seven years before, headed the deputation; a Captain
Tennant and a Captain William Corbet. In the ranks of
the regiment the deputation represented marched other
Irish refugees, who had shed English blood at Wexford and
Enniscorthy; fugitives from political justice before that who
had had a part in the attempted raids of Hoche and Humbert;
“Wild Geese” who had made their flight overseas after the
fiasco of 1803; and a sprinkling of French-born Irish, some of
whom had worn the red coat of the old Irish Brigade in the
Royal Army of France, grandsons of the men of Fontenoy.
Napoleon had enrolled his Irish Legion just a twelvemonth
before, in view of a descent on Ireland from Brest simultaneously
with the crossing of the Straits of Dover from Boulogne. At
the request of those who first came forward to enlist, he had
uniformed the corps in the “national” green, in place of the
former red coat which had been the historic colour of the old
French-Irish regiments ever since James the Second, under the
Treaty of Limerick, carried over to France the remains of the
army that had fought for him at the Boyne. The Eagle the Irish
Legion received on the Field of Mars faced Wellington in Spain,
and narrowly escaped falling into Blücher’s hands in Germany in
1813. It was hidden away after Fontainebleau, and reappeared
during the “Hundred Days,” finally to disappear after Waterloo.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">6</a> Pigtails, too, were missing; for the first time at a military
display of the kind in Paris. Even the soldiers of the Revolution,
the rank and file, had kept up the old style of clubbed-hair. The
new <i lang="fr">régime</i>, however, had altered all that. “Le petit tondu”
(“The little shorn one”), a camp-fire nickname for Napoleon,
from his close-cropped head, had made every soldier cut his
hair short; by a general order of six months before. The order,
it may be mentioned incidentally, at first nearly raised a riot
in the Imperial Guard, and led to a number of duels between
“les canichons,” the “lap-dogs” or “poodles,” as the men
who obeyed the order at the outset were sneeringly dubbed by
comrades who refused to do so, and the others.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a> Ney rode up to head the 6th Light Infantry at the outset,
immediately after a chaffing challenge to Murat. The two,
who had been operating together during the previous days, had
had some difference over their methods of attack. Said Murat
arrogantly on one occasion, after Ney had been laboriously trying
to get into his brother-marshal’s head an elaborate scheme of
his proposed tactics: “I don’t follow your plans. It is my
way not to make mine till I am facing the enemy!” Ney, on
the morning of Elchingen, got his chance to pay Murat back.
They were together, riding close to Napoleon, with all the staff
near by, and not far from the Danube bank. As the guns began
to open, Ney suddenly turned and laid hold of Murat’s arm.
Giving his colleague a rough shake, before the Emperor and
everybody, Ney exclaimed: “Now, Prince, come on! Come
along with me! and make your plans in the face of the enemy!”
The astonished Murat drew himself back, whereupon Ney spurred
up his horse and dashed forward; “galloping off to the river-bank,
he plunged into the water up to his horse’s belly amidst a
shower of cannon-balls and grape, to direct the mending of the
bridge.” That done, he galloped on to head the leading column
of attack across the bridge.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a> Napoleon himself, it so chanced at the outset, heard the
fierce cannonading from afar, and, becoming suddenly alarmed
at what might be happening, was thrown into a fever of anxiety
over it; into a state of violent agitation. It was on the evening
of November 11. Napoleon just then was on his way to take up
his quarters at the Abbey of St. Polten, whence only a few miles
intervened between him and Vienna. As he was nearing St.
Polten he was suddenly alarmed by “the smothered, distant
echo of heavy firing, which was not even interrupted by night.”
So one of the aides de camp on the Emperor’s staff, De Ségur,
describes. “What unforeseen danger could suddenly have
overtaken Mortier? It was almost certainly he who, going
forward with an advanced guard of five thousand men, had
unexpectedly come across Kutusoff with forty thousand. It was
impossible, though, at first, to imagine the destruction of the
marshal and his unhappy division.”</p>

<p>At St. Polten they listened, and in the end feared for the worst.</p>

<p>“One could only offer up prayers and await the decision of
fate! The wide and deep Danube separated us from the marshal.
This stream had just delivered over to the enemy one of Mortier’s
generals, who in despair had tried to make his escape in a boat.
Everything announced a catastrophe: the Emperor no longer
doubted it. In his anxiety, as he drew nearer to the sound of
the combat, while advancing from Moelkt to St. Polten, the fear
of a reverse usurped the place of Napoleon’s former confidence of
victory. Now, his agitation increasing with the noise of the
firing, he despatched everybody for news: officers, aides de
camp; every officer who happened to be near him. With his
mind full of Mortier’s peril he suspended the progress of the
invasion. He stopped Bernadotte and the flotilla behind at
Moelkt. He recalled Murat, dashing on for the gates of Vienna;
and Soult, following Murat. Not indeed until three on the next
afternoon, the 12th of November, was Napoleon’s anxiety allayed
by the arrival of an aide de camp from Mortier.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">9</a> It was to one of these retreating columns that the historic
“Ice Disaster” happened. Every one knows the story, as related
in Napoleon’s Austerlitz Bulletin, and mentioned also by
Ségur, Marbot, and Lejeune in their memoirs, how a column
from the Russian left wing tried to escape over the frozen surface
of the lake of Satschan, how Napoleon turned a battery on them
while in the act of crossing the ice and broke it, and how “thousands
of Russians, with their horses, guns, and waggons, were
seen slowly settling down into the depths.” The actual facts are
recorded in the recently discovered report of the “Fischmeister”
(or overseer) of the Carp Fishery of Satschan Lake, setting forth
the results of draining off the water in the spring of 1806. There
were found at the bottom, recorded the Fischmeister, twenty-eight
cannon, one hundred and fifty dead horses, but only three
human corpses. The column, it would appear, had been composed
of five batteries of artillery, and when the ice was broken,
the guns, all but the two nearest the shore, sank through and
dragged the horses with them to the bottom; but the gunners,
it would seem, were all able to scramble out, except the three
unfortunates who had been either hit by French round-shot, or
were entangled in the harness of their teams. The loss of human
life was therefore, presumably, only three men out of the five
hundred or so who must have been riding on, or with, the guns.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">10</a> Incidentally, that Christmas Day morning of the Schönbrunn
review has an interest for us in this country. Napoleon left
the palace for the review in a vile temper, which no doubt was
one reason why he vented his spleen so savagely on the unfortunate
soldiers of the 4th in his speech of censure. This
was probably the prime cause. Late on the night before, on
Christmas Eve, a courier from Paris had arrived at the Imperial
head-quarters, bringing the defeated Admiral Villeneuve’s
Trafalgar despatch, his “Compte Rendu,” written while Villeneuve
was a prisoner on his way to England, and dated from “A bord de
la frégate Anglaise <i>Euryalus</i>—le 15me Novembre 1805.” It had
been sent to France under a flag of truce, as an act of international
courtesy, and the Minister of Marine forwarded it to
Napoleon. The news of the disaster had reached the Emperor
some five weeks before, at Znaim in Moravia, a fortnight before
Austerlitz; first, from some Austrian officers taken prisoners
by Augereau in the Tyrol, then from the English papers. It
had been enough then to give him a bad night, and make him
morose for a week. Now that he learned the story from his
own admiral, it made him more furious than ever. The original
despatch received by Napoleon at Schönbrunn that Christmas
Eve exists, with its pathetic closing appeal, the pitiless response
to which sent Admiral Villeneuve to a suicide’s grave. “Profondément
pénétré,” it ran, as written by Villeneuve’s own hand,
“de toute l’etendue de mon malheur et de toute la responsibilité
que comporte un aussi grand désastre, je ne désire rien tant que
d’être bientôt à même d’aller mettre aux pieds de S.M. ou la
justification de ma conduite ou la victime qui doit être immolée,
non a l’honneur du pavillon, qui, j’ose le dire, est demeuré intact,
mais aux manes de ceaux qui auroient péri par mon imprudence,
mon inconsidération ou l’oubli de quelqu’un de mes devoirs.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="label">17</a> A gallant young officer of the Guard was the first man to
break through the Russian line in front. With half a dozen
grenadiers he made a dash forward, just as the chasseurs made
their attack. Captain Ernest Auzoni—that was the young
officer’s name—caught sight of a Russian flag a few paces from
him, and, calling on the men of his company, led straight at it,
cutting his way through. “Courage!” he shouted. “Brave
comrades! Follow me!” Auzoni, describes Caulaincourt,
“rushed forward sword in hand, followed by his company, and
penetrated the compact centre of the Russian column: his
sudden assault broke their ranks, and our grenadiers burst in
through the passage opened to them by the brave Auzoni.”</p>

<p>Napoleon, from his post near at hand, was also an eye-witness
of the captain’s daring. On the Russians falling back
after the routing of the column, as the Guard were re-forming
for a fresh advance, he summoned Auzoni and the men of his
company before him. “Captain Auzoni,” began Napoleon as
they stood in front of him, “you well deserve the honour of
commanding my ‘veteran’ <i lang="fr">vieux moustaches</i>; you have most
nobly distinguished yourself. You have won an officer’s cross
and an annuity of two thousand francs. You were made captain
at the beginning of the campaign, and I hope you will return
to Paris with still higher rank. A man who earns his honours
on the field of battle stands very high in my estimation!”
Turning then to the soldiers, Napoleon added: “I award ten
crosses to your company!” With an enthusiastic cheer the
company marched off to rejoin their comrades, and as Caulaincourt
puts it, “the same men advanced to meet the enemy’s
fire with a degree of courage and enthusiasm which is impossible
to describe.”</p>

<p>The brave young Guardsman captain, though, did not see
Paris again. Auzoni met his fate at Eylau. He fell later in the
day, in another charge, in which he took a second Russian flag.
Napoleon himself discovered him, lying at the last gasp among
the mortally wounded on the field. It was next day, as Napoleon,
in accordance with his invariable practice, was riding over the
scene of the battle.</p>

<p>“Near a battery which had been abandoned by the enemy,”
to use again the words of Caulaincourt, “about 150 or 200 French
grenadiers were lying dead, surrounded by four times their
number of Russians. They were lying weltering in a river of
blood, amid broken gun-carriages, muskets, swords, and other
<i lang="fr">débris</i>. They had plainly fought with the most determined
fury, for every corpse showed numerous and horrible wounds.
A feeble cry of ‘Vive l’Empereur!’ was heard as we rode up.
It came from the middle of this mountain of dead, and all eyes
were turned instantly to the spot whence the voice proceeded.
Half concealed beneath a tattered flag lay a young officer whose
breast was decorated with an order. He was still alive, and,
though covered with many wounds, as we stopped by him he
managed to raise himself so as to rest on his elbow. But his
handsome face was overcast with the livid hue of death. He
recognised the Emperor, and, in a feeble, faltering voice, exclaimed:
‘God bless your Majesty! Farewell, farewell! Oh,
my poor mother!’ He turned a look of supplication towards
the Emperor, and with that, with the words on his lips, ‘To my
country, to dear France—my last thoughts!’ he fell back dead.</p>

<p>“Napoleon seemed riveted to the spot. ‘Brave men!’
he exclaimed. ‘Brave Auzoni! Noble young fellow! Ah,
this is a frightful scene! The annuity shall go to his mother:
let the order be presented for my signature as soon as possible!’
Then, turning to Surgeon Ivan, who accompanied him, he said:
‘Examine poor Auzoni’s wounds and see what can be done for
him!’ Nothing however, could be done: the brave youth was
beyond medical aid.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="label">18</a> The Old Guard was recruited from the <i lang="fr">élite</i> of the Line.
After every battle soldiers who had been particularly prominent
in the fighting were specially transferred to the Old Guard; a
form of advancement much coveted among the rank and file.
At all times there was great competition to enter the Guard,
and every regimental colonel kept “waiting lists,” in anticipation
of vacancies, on which names were sometimes down for years.
Service in the Old Guard meant, in addition to the prestige of
enrolment in so favoured a corps, life amid the gaieties and pleasures
of Paris, with increased pay and personal privileges; and
the highly estimated honour of a special weekly inspection by
the Emperor himself in the Courtyard of the Carrousel, at which
Napoleon invariably walked in and out among the ranks, talking
to the men; and any Guardsman who had a grievance might then
personally lay it before the Emperor. The private in the Guard
drew seven sous a day as compared with the one sou pay of the
private of the Line. Off duty, the private of the Guard ranked
on an equality with a sergeant of the Line, and in army social
circles was entitled to be addressed by the Linesmen he met as
“Monsieur.”</p>

<p>Only men of unblemished record were qualified for admission
to the Old Guard. A colonel of a Line regiment on one occasion
sent a man into the Guard who turned out a <i lang="fr">mauvais sujet</i>.
Napoleon ordered the unfortunate colonel to be publicly reprimanded
on parade, and confined to his quarters for three days;
and further had his name and offence put in General Army
Orders, issued for universal circulation from the War Office,
and posted up at the head-quarters of every regiment throughout
the service.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="label">19</a> Baron Lejeune, on the Imperial staff at Wagram, who was
clever with his pencil, was specially desired by Napoleon to
design the costume for the Eagle-Guard, as he himself relates.
“Anxious to confer distinction on those brave fellows who had
taken part in the actual defence of the flag, the Eagle of their
regiment, Napoleon conceived the idea of giving them a costume
and equipment which should mark them out as specially honoured,
and at the same time be suitable to the duties they had to perform.
The Emperor therefore sent for me and asked me to make
a sketch of a costume such as he wished to give to what he called
his ‘Eagle-Guard,’ or those non-commissioned officers whose
office it was to surround and defend the actual standard-bearers.
The chief weapons of each were to be a pistol, a sword, and a
lance, so that in the heat of the battle they would never have to
trouble themselves about loading a gun. There was to be gold
on their epaulettes, sword-belts, and helmets. I made a drawing
and took it to the Emperor, and he sent it to the Minister of
War with his own instructions on the subject.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="label">20</a> Colonel Lejeune was again called in to design the decoration
for the Order, and has recorded what Napoleon said to him.
“‘The Order of the Golden Fleece,’ he said, ‘is typical of
victory; my Eagles have triumphed over the Golden Fleeces
of the King of Spain and the Emperors of Germany, so I mean
to create for the French Empire an Imperial Order of the Three
Golden Fleeces. The sign of this order shall be my own Eagle
with outspread wings, holding in each of its talons one of the
ancient Golden Fleeces it has carried off; whilst hanging from its
beak it will proudly display the Fleece I now institute.’ He
then took a pen and roughly marked out the size I was to make
my drawing.... I made the drawings as desired, and he issued
the order accordingly. The institution of the new Order was
duly announced in the <i>Moniteur</i>; but the terms of the treaty
of peace compelled him to suppress a distinction the chief aim
of which had been to humiliate the conquered countries of
Spain and Austria.”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">21</a> They were to be merely identifying tokens. “If by misfortune,”
Napoleon went so far as to say, “fanions should fall
into the enemy’s hands, it will be apparent from their plain
appearance that their capture is a matter of no account.” “Une
affaire sans conséquence” were Napoleon’s words.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="label">22</a> It was during the battle at Ratisbon that Napoleon, according
to the story, was wounded for the only time in his life,
and had to dismount, and, in the sight of the dismayed soldiers,
have his wound dressed by a surgeon, the news causing consternation
through the ranks of the whole army far and wide.
Indeed, only this year there was placed in the Army Museum at the
Invalides, as an historic relic of the highest interest, “the fragment
of a shell that struck Napoleon at Ratisbon on the 23rd of April,
1809, and gave him the only wound he ever received in battle.”
The truth is revealed in M. Combes’ journal, which, after telling
how Napoleon carefully concealed everything which might detract
from his reputation among his soldiers for invulnerability, enumerates
his wounds in detail. After his death half a dozen scars
were found on his body. There was the mark of a wound on his
head, a hole above his left knee, either from a bayonet or a lance,
the mark of the injury received at Ratisbon, another on one
hand, and on the body the scars of sword cuts and slashes.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">23</a> As to this last trophy, it was unfortunate from our point of
view—since Fate willed that the 5th of the Line should lose its
colours to an enemy—that one of the original Battalion Eagles
of the corps had previously, in accordance with Napoleon’s order
of 1808, been returned to Paris. The half-winged Eagle of the
5th would have made a notable trophy for Chelsea Hospital.
While heading an attack on an Austrian field-work in Masséna’s
battle at Caldiero on the Venetian frontier in November 1805,
the Eagle was smashed from its staff by a grape-shot and dashed
violently to the ground, with one wing shattered. At the same
time the battalion recoiled before the terrific fire with which its
charge was met. The Eagle saved the honour of the corps.
Picking its battered remains up and waving it at arm’s-length
above his head, with a shout of “Come on, comrades! follow the
Eagle,” one of the officers rushed with it through the <i lang="fr">mêlée</i> to
the front and led the forlorn-hope onset that stormed the post.
After that, the Eagle, lashed to the stump of its broken pole,
went through the battle to the end, doing its part in rallying the
battalion round it, to keep at bay greatly superior numbers of
the enemy until relief arrived. There had been almost a mutiny
in the 5th in 1808 when they were ordered to return their battle-scarred
ensign to the Invalides, but the order was obeyed. Otherwise
the half-winged Eagle would have been at Chelsea now.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">24</a> The present imitation Eagle at Chelsea was specially cast in
brass from a mould of one of other trophies; one of the Eagles
of the 82nd being used as the model. The imitation wreath was
made from a sketch by an old officer of the Hospital staff. The
Eagle and wreath were specially reproduced in order that the
Barrosa Eagle trophy should be represented among the Peninsular
and Waterloo Eagles displayed together at the head of the
catafalque on the occasion of the lying-in-state at Chelsea of the
remains of the Duke of Wellington, seven months after the
theft. The dummy is in the Chapel at Chelsea now, with a brass
tablet beneath it notifying that it is not the original Eagle, set
up where the Barrosa Eagle used to be, in front of the organ-loft.
The existing staff, however, is genuine. It is the Eagle-pole that
the thief threw away in his fright; the staff actually borne by
the Porte-Aigle of Napoleon’s 8th of the Line under fire at

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">27</a> Southey, in his <cite>History of the Peninsular War</cite>, makes this
ugly suggestion in regard to the Eagle trophies of Salamanca:
“It is said that more than <em>ten</em> were captured, but that there
were men base enough to conceal them and sell them to persons
in Salamanca who deemed it good policy, as well as a profitable
speculation, to purchase them for the French.” It may be,
as to that, that Marmont’s army lost more than the two Eagles
now at Chelsea. It is of course possible that camp followers
and Spanish peasants of the locality, wandering over the battlefield
to strip and plunder the dead on the day after the battle,
when Wellington and the army were miles away, picked up
Eagles on the scene of so tremendous a disaster for the French.
They might easily traffic in them with French agents at Salamanca,
well aware of their value if they could be secretly restored
to their regiments. It is, however, inconceivable that British
soldiers could have acted as alleged and been guilty of the
dastardly crime that Southey hints at. Four Eagle-poles, with
screw tops and the Eagles gone, were found on the field by British
burying-parties; but those were all, and one of the four may
have been the pole of the Eagle of the 62nd.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">28</a> As to Napoleon’s opinion in regard to the preservation of
trophies so acquired, see his memo to Ney at Magdeburg, quoted

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">29</a> Napoleon had given permission to his marshals in Spain to
grant colonels of regiments, in certain circumstances, discretionary
powers as to the disposal of their Eagles. Colonels were authorised,
when their regiments were proceeding on what might be
considered “exceptionally hazardous service,” or when operating
in difficult country, to keep the Eagles back, and leave them in
camp or in a fortress. That is how Wellington in 1812 came to
find the Eagles of the 13th and 51st of the Line at Madrid.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">30</a> On July 28, 1813, in a skirmish in the Pyrenees, the 40th
(now the 2nd Somersetshire Regiment) surrounded and captured
the French 32nd of the Line, rounding its First Battalion up in
a valley and charging it with the bayonet, 24 officers and 700
men being taken. The Eagle had been thrown into a rapid
mountain torrent in sight of our men, during the retreat of the
32nd, but it was impossible to prevent it, or to recover the Eagle
afterwards.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">31</a> Others of the Eagles had narrow escapes during the Peninsular
War. In the fighting south of the Douro, near Grijon, on the
day before Wellington’s passage of the river at Oporto, the
31st Light Infantry all but lost their Eagle on being charged by
the British 14th and 20th Light Dragoons. The 31st broke in
confusion before the British onset, and only rallied some miles
from the battlefield. “Our losses,” described one of the officers,
“were very heavy, but our Eagle, which had been in extreme
peril in the encounter, was happily saved.” Again, in the pursuit
up the mountain side after the defeat of Girard’s Division
at Arroyo dos Molinos, the Eagles of the 34th and 40th of the
Line escaped capture—although both regiments were all but
annihilated—to Marshal Soult’s expressed relief. In reporting
the reverse to Napoleon, Soult added this by way of solatium:
“L’honneur des armes est sauvé; les Aigles ne sont pas tombés
au pouvoir de l’ennemi.” After Talavera, the Eagle of the
25th of the Line was picked up on the battlefield by a party of
the King’s German Legion—it was sent to Hanover and is now
in Berlin; also, during the battle, the British 29th took two
Eagle-poles in a charge, but with the Eagles unscrewed from the
tops and removed by the Eagle-bearers at the last moment and
carried out of the fight under their coats.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">32</a> Elsewhere are other permanent trophies of the campaign,
spoils of another kind. Nine hundred and twenty-nine of
Napoleon’s cannon fell into Russian hands, mostly abandoned
during the retreat, without attempt at defence. Of these, most
are fittingly kept at Moscow; they number 875, and are exhibited
in the arsenal, or mounted as trophies in the public
squares in the Holy City. As with the flags, they are not all
French. Those bearing the French Imperial cypher, the letter
“N” surmounted by the Eagle and Napoleonic crown, number
less than a half of the total. The French guns number 365; the
bulk of the collection being made up of artillery from allied and
vassal states: 189 Austrian cannon, 123 Prussian, 70 Italian,
40 Neapolitan, 34 Bavarian, 22 Dutch, 12 Saxon, 8 Spanish,
5 Polish, with 7 Westphalian, Würtemburg, and Hanoverian
pieces. The Prussian and Austrian guns, most of them, it is
fair to say, were not captured from the contingents serving with
the Grand Army in Russia: they formed part of the artillery
marching with Napoleon’s main column; they belonged to the
French army, and were manned by French gunners, being
spoils from the Austerlitz, Wagram, and Jena campaigns, turned
to account to form field batteries for the French army. Innumerable
other reminders of the fate of the Grand Army are
preserved all over Russia: soldiers’ arms and accoutrements,
personal belongings and decorations of French officers and men,
fragments of uniforms, helmets, swords and lances, pistols and
muskets; relics mostly picked up on battlefields or by the
wayside along the route of the retreat. The muskets serve to
illustrate incidentally, in the variety of the woods used for their
stocks, the makeshifts to which, some time before 1812, the
demands of Napoleon’s armaments had reduced France: the
musket-stocks of oak, chestnut, elm, beech, maple, of even
poplar and deal, tell a tale of exhausted supplies of the walnut
and ash woods ordinarily used in the manufacture of firearms.</p>

<p>The total of 75 Eagles and other standards is no extravagantly
large array of trophies, remembering the overwhelming nature
of the catastrophe to the Grand Army in Russia. Of the 600,000
soldiers who mustered round their regimental colours at the
crossing of the Niemen at the outset of the campaign, 125,000
were killed in fight, and 193,048, according to the Russian official
returns, were taken prisoners. In round numbers 250,000 died
on the line of march during the retreat, from cold, hardships,
and starvation, or were killed as stragglers by the Cossacks and
peasants. The mementoes also of their grim fate exist to-day in
Russia. The graves of most of them may be seen all along the
railway line from Wilna to Moscow, which follows closely the route
of Napoleon and the Grand Army, over country the same in
appearance now as then; a dreary, wind-swept, lonesome plain,
broken only by vast stretches of dark, monotonous birch and
pine forests, with here and there narrow ravines, and strips of
hilly ground, amid which wind chill and sluggish rivers. At
intervals huge mounds, looking like embankments or ancient
barrows of enormous size, rise over the flat expanse of plain.
They are the graves of the French dead. It took three months
to destroy the remains of the dead soldiers and of some 150,000
horses which perished in the campaign. The ghastly task was
carried out locally by the peasantry, under an urgent Government
order, so as to prevent the outbreak of pestilence in the
spring from the vast numbers of unburied corpses that strewed
the track of the ill-fated host. The bodies, when the snow
thawed, were dragged together and collected in heaps each “half
a verst long and two fathoms high,” over 500 yards long and some
14 feet high. At first, efforts were made to burn them, but the
supply of firewood failed, and the stench all over the country
was unbearable. The corpses were then hauled into shallow
trenches alongside, and quicklime and earth heaped over them,
making the mounds now to be seen along the railway, on either
side of the old post-road from Wilna to Moscow, the route of
Napoleon’s retreat. In the province of Moscow, 50,000 dead
soldiers and 29,000 dead horses were so disposed of before the
middle of February; in the province of Smolensk, by the end
of the month, 72,000 dead soldiers and 52,000 horses; in the
province of Minsk, 40,000 human corpses and 28,000 horses;
to which, later on, when the ice had melted, 12,000 more dead
soldiers were added, the bodies found in the Beresina; in the
province of Wilna, also by the end of February, 73,000 dead
soldiers, with 10,000 dead horses. There were, in addition, very
many never accounted for: dead stragglers who had perished
in the forests, their remains being devoured by the wolves; and
those who were massacred—beaten to death, or buried alive,
or burned alive—by the peasants in places away from the line
of march. Such was the appalling loss of life that attended
the Moscow campaign, and which the trophies represent. In the
circumstances, in proportion, the toll is hardly a large one.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">33</a> The wolves killed many of the stragglers as they wandered
in search of food or shelter from the cold, away from the retreating
columns. They followed in the track of the Grand Army to the
last, across Germany to the Rhine. It is the fact, indeed, that
the presence of wolves to-day in the forest lands of Central
Europe is largely due to the tremendous incursion of ravenous
brutes from Russia which swept in huge swarms in rear of
Napoleon’s ill-fated host.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">34</a> Coignet, then a lieutenant of the Old Guard, thus speaks
of the horrors of those latter days immediately following the
Beresina: “The cold continued to grow more intense; the
horses in the bivouacs died of hunger and cold. Every day
some were left where we had passed the night. The roads were
like glass. The horses fell down, and could not get up. Our
worn-out soldiers no longer had strength to carry their arms.
The barrels of their guns were so cold that they stuck to their
hands. It was twenty-eight degrees below zero. But the
Guard gave up their knapsacks and guns only with their lives.
In order to save our lives, we had to eat the horses that fell upon
the ice. The soldiers opened the skin with their knives, and
took out the entrails, which they roasted on the coals, if they
had time to make a fire; and, if not, they ate them raw. They
devoured the horses before they died. I also ate this food as
long as the horses lasted. As far as Wilna we travelled by
short stages with the Emperor. His whole staff marched along
the sides of the road. The men of the demoralised army marched
along like prisoners, without arms and without knapsacks.
There was no longer any discipline or any human feeling for one
another. Each man looked out for himself. Every sentiment
of humanity was extinguished. No one would have reached
out his hand to his father; and that can easily be understood.
For he who stooped down to help his fellow would not be able to
rise again. We had to march right on, making faces to prevent
our noses and ears from freezing. The men became insensible
to every human feeling. No one even murmured
against our misfortunes. The men fell, frozen stiff, all along the
road. If, by chance, any of them came upon a bivouac of other
unfortunate creatures who were thawing themselves, the newcomers
pitilessly pushed them aside, and took possession of their
fire. The poor creatures would then lie down to die upon the
snow. One must have seen these horrors in order to believe
them.... But it was at Wilna that we suffered most. The
weather was so severe that the men could no longer endure it:
even the ravens froze.”</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">35</a> One of those who presented arms before Napoleon at the
Rheims review died, just twenty years ago, as the last French
survivor of Trafalgar—André Manuel Cartigny. At Trafalgar
he had been a powder-boy on board the celebrated <i>Redoutable</i>,
from the mizen-top of which the bullet was fired which killed
Nelson. He paraded at Rheims among the remnant of survivors

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">36</a> General Dupont, an officer of the highest promise and with
an exceptionally brilliant record, Ney’s right-hand man, and
chief divisional leader on many battlefields, a special favourite
also with Napoleon (“a man I loved and was rearing up to be
a marshal,” were Napoleon’s words of him), while on the expedition
which was to win him the bâton, at the head of 25,000
men, let himself be surrounded and cut off; trapped among the
gorges of the Sierra Morena by a horde of peasants backed up
by Spanish regulars; and then, in spite of a final chance that
offered for him to force his way through, surrendered to the
enemy. He had committed “<i lang="fr">une chose sans exculpe; une
lacheté insultante</i>,” declared Napoleon in savage fury on hearing
of the surrender. Those who had had part in it, declared the
Emperor, should “die on the scaffold”—“ils porteront sur
l’échaffaud la peine de ce grand crime national!” He had
Brigadier Legendre, Dupont’s Chief of the Staff, who had been
released on parole, brought before him at Valladolid, and heaped
on the wretched, broken man the bitterest reproaches and
revilings; beside himself in his wrath. Not a word in reply, in
explanation, would he listen to. Before the Imperial Guard
on parade, and the assembled Imperial Staff, Napoleon finally
gripped the general by the wrist and shook it passionately.
An onlooker, another officer, describes the scene: “A nervous
contraction of the muscles seemed to seize the Emperor. ‘What,
General!’ he ejaculated, his voice quivering with fury. ‘Why
did not your hand wither when it signed that infamous capitulation!’”
Legendre was cashiered: Dupont (who had been
ill and was wounded during the battle) was cashiered, degraded
from the Legion of Honour, and kept under police <i lang="fr">surveillance</i> as
long as the Empire lasted.</p>

<p>What became of the other two Eagles, those of the “Garde
de Paris” and of the Second Battalion of the 5th Light Infantry,
and the fourteen Reserve Battalion flags that were taken at
Bailen is unknown. They are not in Spain, although one trophy
indirectly associated with the disaster is now at Madrid, the
admiral’s flag of Admiral Rosily, who was at Cadiz with the
French squadron which Dupont was marching to rescue. It is
kept as a trophy in the Museo Naval of Madrid. Rosily had
charge of the five French ships of the line which escaped into
Cadiz after Trafalgar. When Spain rose against Napoleon, they
were placed in danger from the garrison of Cadiz; being at the
same time unable to put to sea because a British fleet blockaded
the port. Dupont’s army was specially sent to bring away the
4,000 soldiers and sailors on board, who were then to abandon
the ships. Just before Dupont reached Bailen, the Spaniards
attacked Rosily, bombarding his ships with heavy cannon, and
mortars and a gunboat flotilla, and he had to surrender, his
admiral’s flag being carried off by the Spaniards, ultimately to
find its way to its present resting-place.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">37</a> Years later these trophies were again brought to light, and
by degrees, one at a time, or two or three together, found their
way once more to the Hôtel, where they form part of the present
collection. Among those now in the Invalides are six of
Frederick the Great’s trophies annexed at Berlin by Napoleon
in 1806; six Austrian and Bavarian flags, also of the Seven
Years’ War period, removed by Napoleon from Vienna; an old
German flag taken by Marshal Turenne, and in earlier times hung
in Notre Dame; five Austrian colours of unknown origin; one
Russian flag-trophy from Austerlitz; one Prussian standard
from Jena; and a number of Spanish and Portuguese flags from
the Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Three British regimental flags, originally captured by Napoleon’s
Polish lancers at Albuera, found their way back in this
manner to the Invalides. They were taken at Albuera in the
first part of the battle, when, under cover of mist and rain squalls,
the French cavalry, circling round one flank, swooped down on
the leading British brigade before its regiments could form in
square. Of the five other British flags at present in the Invalides,
four were taken on March 8, 1814, just three weeks before
the burning of the trophies, and had not yet reached Paris.
They were taken from us in very tragic circumstances—at the
disastrous attempt to storm the fortress of Bergen-op-Zoom;
but the details of that painful story nor the identification of the
flags do not concern us here. One of the four flags is kept beside
Napoleon’s tomb. The fifth flag purports to have been a British
sloop-of-war’s red ensign and to have been captured in the
Baltic in December 1813, in an action of which the British
Admiralty has no record, and the French account is only a
tradition. It again, apparently, had not reached Paris by March
1814.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">38</a> To the Army, Louis XVIII. was only a King imposed on
them by their enemies; by the triumphant enemies of France,
the European Coalition. He was merely the “<i lang="fr">protégé</i> of foreign
bayonets,” placed over them by the English and Prussians;
“l’émigré rentré en croupe derrière un cosaque!” To the
soldiers he only personified defeat and disaster; and the memories
that they gloried in had been of set purpose obliterated by him
and his creatures. The very charter under which he had assumed
authority was dated the 19th year of his reign, as though
Napoleon had never been. He had proscribed their Eagle
standards before which all Europe had trembled. By his ordinances
he had abolished and insulted the memory of their victories.
In addition he had disbanded and turned adrift their
officers, and had left them to starve, without the pay that was
their due, in wretchedness and rags.</p>

<p>Fuel was added to the fires of disaffection in the ranks by the
tales that went round of every barrack-room of personal ill-usage
of and affronts to officers who had won the respect of all
on campaign, and before the enemy under fire. <i lang="fr">Ci-devant</i> colonels
and captains in long-forgotten corps of the old-time Royal Army
were appointed at one stride Lieutenant-Generals and Major-Generals
on the Active List, ousting and sending into unemployment
men, whom Napoleon himself had picked out for command,
whose names were household words to the Army. In almost
every regiment officers who had grown grey in war-service before
the enemy, who had won distinction on a hundred battlefields,
were shelved; set aside for <i lang="fr">émigrés</i>, who, a quarter of a century
before, had been boy subalterns in the army of the <i lang="fr">ancien
régime</i>, and had not set foot in France since they fled the country
at the outbreak of the Revolution. These were brought back
and posted wholesale as colonels and <i lang="fr">chefs de bataillon</i> all
through the Army, superseding and driving into poverty veterans
who had raised themselves to their ranks and positions through
personal merit and war-service, and had qualified step by step
in the different grades. At a <i lang="fr">levée</i> one day, after a review before
the Duc de Berri, a grey-headed old regimental officer stepped
forward, according to custom, and made a request to have
granted to him for his services the Cross of St. Louis. “What
have you done to deserve it?” was the Prince’s reply, uttered
in a cold and sneering tone. “I have served in the Army of
France for twenty years, your Royal Highness!” “Twenty
years of robbery!” was the cruel and insolent answer as the
Duc de Berri turned his back on the veteran. The words were
repeated everywhere among the soldiers and had the worst
effect. Another tale that caused deep resentment throughout
the Army was that of the treatment which Marshal Ney had
received at Court when protesting against rudeness which had
been shown by certain ladies of title to his wife one day at the
Tuileries. They had openly insulted the Maréchale Ney by
making sarcastic and contemptuous comments on her comparatively
lowly birth. Marshal Ney personally complained to the
King, but was coldly referred to the Court Chamberlain. He
laid his complaint before that functionary and was personally
rebuffed “in a harsh and insolent manner”—as the only reply
to which the Marshal with his wife had withdrawn from Paris
altogether. And more than one other officer of eminence, it
was told, had in like manner been forced to cease attendance
at Court. When the moment came for the reappearance of
Napoleon in their midst, the Army was more than ready to receive
their old leader with open arms and rally once more to the
Eagles.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">39</a> It was the action of Marshal Ney that sealed the fate of the
Bourbon <i lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<p>Ney had accepted the Restoration as bringing peace to exhausted
France; he had given in his allegiance to the Bourbons.
Angry and sick at heart as he was over the ill-treatment meted
out to his brother officers, and the humiliations that the new
<i lang="fr">régime</i> had inflicted on the Army, and sore over personal grievances
of his own, he had, in spite of all, loyally held back from
intriguing against the restored dynasty. Napoleon’s leaving
Elba, when he first heard the news, he condemned outspokenly
as a crime against France. Impulsive and headstrong by nature,
he forgot his grievances, and hastened to Paris to offer his sword
to the King. Napoleon, he said to the King at the interview
at the Tuileries, which was immediately granted him, was a
madman and deserved to be brought to Paris “like a bandit in
an iron cage.” So hostile witnesses at Ney’s court-martial
declared, though Ney himself emphatically denied using any
words of the kind. His services were accepted gladly, for Ney
was the most popular of all the marshals with the soldiers, and
he was sent to lead the army against Napoleon. Besançon was
proposed as his head-quarters, and he betook himself there.</p>

<p>Almost at once, however, anxieties and doubts beset Ney.
On taking up his command he found but few regiments available.
He was promised reinforcements, but none arrived, and while
he waited, no news of the rapidly altering situation reached him
from Paris. Meanwhile the news came steadily in from all
sides that the soldiers could not be trusted to oppose Napoleon.
Ney was still loyal to the Bourbons, and he moved his troops
nearer the line of advance Napoleon was taking; to Lons le
Saulnier, midway between Besançon and Lyons. To officers
who hinted that the soldiers would not fight if Napoleon appeared,
Ney answered angrily: “They <em>shall</em> fight. I will take
a musket and begin the firing myself! I will run my sword
through the first man who hesitates!”</p>

<p>But events were moving too fast: the tide of Bonapartism
was rising visibly on all sides. Napoleon, Ney heard, was being
received everywhere with acclamation; the soldiers were said
to be declaring for him by thousands. Already in every garrison
the soldiers were displaying their old Eagle cap-badges and
tricolor cockades. “Every soldier in the Army,” relates Savary
in his Memoirs, “had preserved his tricolor cockade and the
Eagle-badge of his shako or cap. It was needless for any order
to be given for their resumption; that had been done on the
first intelligence of the Emperor’s landing in France.” Everywhere
too, officers who had kept back and hidden the old regimental
Eagles and tricolor standards, were bringing them out
openly. In regiments where the Ministerial order had been
obeyed and the Eagles sent to Paris for destruction, the soldiers
now took out the Bourbon arms from the white flags, substituting
a tricolor shield for the royal shield with the three fleurs-de-lis.</p>

<p>Ney next began to doubt what line of conduct he ought to
adopt. On one side was his oath of allegiance to the King. On
the other was the prospect of a civil war which would be ruinous
to France, which he, at the head of his army, had it in his power
to prevent. It became borne in on him as his duty to the country
in the circumstances to throw his influence on the side of
his old comrades and Napoleon. His personal grievances against
the Bourbons rankled in his mind, and self-interest urged him
to go with the stream; but it was rather a sense of duty and
patriotism, to avert a civil war, that impelled Ney to take the
action that he did. His final decision was influenced by an insidiously
worded letter from Napoleon, playing on Ney’s personal
feelings and calling him by his old name of “the Bravest of the
Brave.” The letter was brought to him by two secret emissaries
on the night of March 13, who urged on the marshal that his
soldiers were about to abandon him, and that it was impossible
for him single-handed to hope to stem the current of national
feeling. That and the letter turned the scale. Ney decided to
abandon the cause of the Bourbons.</p>

<p>Assembling his troops on parade next day, he publicly declared
for Napoleon in a fiery proclamation addressed to the
Army. “Officers, under-officers, and soldiers,” Ney began,
reading out the proclamation from on horseback in front of
the assembled battalions, “the cause of the Bourbons is lost
for ever! The dynasty adopted by the French nation is about
to reascend the throne. To the Emperor Napoleon, our
Sovereign, alone belongs the right of reigning in our dear country.”
The proclamation concluded with these words: “Soldiers,
I have often led you to victory. I will now conduct you to that
immortal phalanx which the Emperor Napoleon is leading towards
Paris. It will arrive there within a few days, when our
hopes and our happiness will be for ever realised. Long live
the Emperor!”</p>

<p>The declaration came as fire to a train of gunpowder. Ney
had hardly uttered a dozen words before frantic exclamations
and shouts burst forth; shakos and caps and helmets were raised
and waved on muskets and swords, amid tumultuous cries of
“Vive l’Empereur!” “Vive le Maréchal Ney!” The men
broke their ranks and rushed headlong round Ney, catching hold
of him and kissing his hands and feet and uniform: “those
not near enough kissing his embarrassed aides de camp.”
Shouted some: “We knew you would not leave us in the hands
of the <i lang="fr">émigrés</i>!” The marshal at the close was escorted back
to his quarters amid a crowd of excited soldiers cheering frantically.</p>

<p>The scene there was very different. Arrived in his quarters,
Ney found himself at once surrounded by a group of anxious
and nervous staff-officers and aides de camp. Said some: “You
should have informed us of it before, M. le Maréchal! We
ought not to have been made witnesses of such a spectacle!”
One or two officers protested and resigned on the spot. One
aide de camp, indeed, a former <i lang="fr">émigré</i>, broke his sword in two
and flung the pieces at Ney’s feet. “It is easier,” he exclaimed
passionately, “for a man of honour to break iron than to break
his word.”</p>

<p>“You are children,” was the marshal’s answer. “It is
necessary to do one thing or the other. What would you have
me do? Can I stop the advancing sea with my hands? Can I
go and hide like a coward to avoid the responsibility of events I
cannot alter? Marshal Ney cannot take refuge in the dark!
There is but one way to deal with the evil—to take one side and
avert civil war. So we shall get into our hands the man who has
returned, and prevent his committing further follies. I am not
going over to a man, but to my country.”</p>

plainer in design than the flags of 1804 and 1808. They were of
the ordinary pattern of the national banner, three vertical bands
of colour, edged with golden fringe. Lettered in gold on the
white central band of the flag was the Imperial dedication,
worded similarly to the inscription on the older flags, and on
the reverse the names of the battles in which the corps had taken
part—“Austerlitz,” “Jena,” etc.</p>

June 12, after spending several hours in his cabinet, issuing
orders and making arrangements for the carrying on of the
Government in his absence. Caulaincourt, acting for the time
being as Foreign Minister, was with Napoleon until the last
moment, and witnessed his departure. “The clock struck three,
and daylight was beginning to appear. ‘Farewell, Caulaincourt!’
said the Emperor, holding out his hand to me, ‘Farewell!
We must conquer or die!’ With hurried steps he passed
through the apartments, his mind being evidently fully taken up
with melancholy thoughts. On reaching the foot of the staircase,
he cast a lingering look round him, and then threw himself into
his carriage and drove away.”</p>

had a distinguished representative at Waterloo in the person of
the officer at the head of the Artillery of the Imperial Guard,
General Drouot. He had fought against Nelson as a major of
artillery doing duty in the French fleet. His ship was one of the
few that escaped into Cadiz after the battle, whence he was
recalled to join the Grand Army in the Jena campaign. Drouot
was the officer who, during the retreat from Moscow—where he
brought the artillery of the Guard through without losing a gun—“washed
his face and shaved in the open air, affixing his looking-glass
to a gun-carriage, every day, regardless of the thermometer!”</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">43</a> Napoleon—it may be of general interest to add—passed the
whole of the day, between the review in the forenoon and late
in the afternoon when he rode forward to witness the Guard
start for the last charge, on the ridge of high ground near Rossomme,
So the memoirs of the officers of his staff unanimously
record. At no time was he near the so-called “observatory,” in
regard to which there has recently been a controversy, based on
the publication of a letter by the eminent surgeon, Sir Charles
Bell, who was at Waterloo, and rendered very valuable service to
the wounded. This is the story as told in his letter by Dr. Bell:</p>

<p>“About half a mile of ascent brought us to the position of
Bonaparte. This is the highest ground in the Pays Bas. I
climbed up one of the pillars of the scaffolding, as I was wont
to do after birds’ nests.... We got a ladder from the farm-court;
it reached near the first platform. I mounted and climbed with
some difficulty; none of the rest would venture.... The view
was magnificent. I was only one-third up the machine, yet it
was a giddy height. Here Bonaparte stood surveying the field.</p>

<p>“This position of Bonaparte is most excellent; the machine
had been placed by the side of the road, but he ordered it to be
shifted. The shifting of this scaffolding shows sufficiently the
power of confidence and the resolution of the man. It is about
sixty feet in height. I climbed upon it about four times the
length of my body, by exact measurement, and this was only the
first stage. I was filled with admiration for a man of his habit
of life who could stand perched on a height of sixty-five feet
above everything, and contemplate, see, and manage such a
scene.”</p>

<p>Mention of the scaffold-platform is also made by Sir Walter
Scott, who rode over the field in August 1815. Sir Walter gives
this version, in a letter to the Duke of Buccleuch:</p>

<p>“The story of his (Napoleon’s) having an observatory erected
for him is a mistake. There is such a thing, and he repaired to
it during the action; but it was built or erected some months
before, for the purpose of a trigonometrical survey of the country,
by the King of the Netherlands.”</p>

<p>Thomas Kelly, an enterprising London publisher, went further.
He had a picture of the erection drawn, and brought it out as a
popular print in October 1815, under the title of “Bonaparte’s
Observatory to view the Battle of Waterloo.” The print shows
a three-tiered structure, apparently quite lately constructed,
with three platforms, and ladders leading from one platform to
the other. Napoleon himself is depicted on top, his spy-glass at
his eye, and with two staff officers in attendance.</p>

<p>There certainly was a structure of the kind on the field.
Such a thing, in a dilapidated condition, is to be seen in miniature
on the Siborne model of the battlefield at the Royal United
Service Institution. It is made to scale, and in its essential
features bears out Dr. Bell’s description. It stands close to the
“wood of Callois” by the Nivelle road, rather more than a mile
to the south of Hougoumont. It has only one platform, whence
it would overlook the trees and give a good view of the battle.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in addition to the silence of all Napoleon’s
officers on the subject, we have this plain statement
from Frances Lady Shelley, an intimate friend of the Duke of
Wellington, who was in Paris during the occupation after the
battle and was also taken over the battlefield by the Duke of
Richmond some three months after Waterloo. It appears in her
recently published Diary, at p. 173, and may be taken as settling
the fate of the story of “this towering and massive perch,”
“that wonderful scaffold,” “that huge scaffolding,” “part of
Napoleon’s equipment at Waterloo,” as a modern historical
writer calls it.</p>

<p>This is what Lady Shelley wrote at the time:</p>

<p>“Throughout the battle of Waterloo Napoleon remained
on a mound, within cannon shot, but beyond the range of musketry
fire. He certainly was not in the observatory after the battle
began; nor could he have from that spot directed the movements
of his troops. That observatory was built for topographical
reasons by a former Governor of the Netherlands
something like a century ago.”</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">44</a> The “fanion” of the second battalion of the 45th shared
the fate of the regimental Eagle. It fell to Private Wheeler
of the 28th, the “Slashers,” the present 1st Battalion of the
Gloucestershire Regiment. The 28th, on the left of Picton’s
line, had, like the Highlanders, charged forward among the
French, following close after the Greys. Wheeler, after a fierce
fight with the bearer of the “fanion,” in which he was severely
wounded, bayoneted the French sergeant and carried off the
trophy. It disappeared in an unexplained manner some days later,
during Wellington’s march on Paris, while being forwarded to
the Duke’s head-quarters.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">45</a> The news of Waterloo reached Paris just twenty-four hours
earlier than it reached London—during the night of Tuesday,
June 20. How it was broken to the French capital forms a
story little less dramatic than the other story of how the news
of Waterloo arrived in London. In Paris they had had news
of the successful opening of the campaign. On the 18th, just
as Napoleon was holding his last review, before Waterloo opened,
the “triumphal battery” of the Invalides was firing a <i lang="fr">feu de joie</i>
in honour of victory over Blücher at Ligny. On Monday and
Tuesday, the 19th and 20th, Napoleon’s Ligny Bulletin, with
details, was published in the <i>Moniteur</i>. When the cafés closed
that evening, there was as yet no word of Waterloo. But at that
same moment the news was arriving—in a private message to
Carnot, the Minister of the Interior. What had happened
leaked out first at his house.</p>

<p>“On that evening,” describes M. Edgar Quinet, “several
persons were assembled at the house of M. Carnot, and they
vainly asked him for news. To evade these importunate questions,
Carnot went to a card-table and sat down with three of
his friends. He from whom I have this story sat opposite the
Minister. By chance he raised his eyes and looked at Carnot;
he saw his countenance, serious, furrowed, with tears pouring
down it. The cards were thrown up; the players rose. ‘The
battle is lost!’ exclaimed Carnot, who could contain himself
no longer.” The news spread through Paris like wild-fire. It
was not believed at first; the catastrophe was too stunning, too
terrible. To that succeeded a gloomy stupor (une morne stupeur).</p>

<p>“They had not long to wait. All was known next morning.
The astounding news of the rout of the army in Belgium, and
the still more astounding news of the arrival of Napoleon in
Paris, were spread through the great city almost simultaneously,
and stirred to the depths its restless and volatile population.
Twice before had Napoleon suddenly returned to Paris—from
Moscow, from Leipsic—and each time alone, without an army.
Thus had he again presented himself.”</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of the pages that referenced them,
have been collected, sequentially renumbered, and placed at the end of
the main text, just before the Index.</p>

<p>Odd-page running headings appear here as Sidenotes,
usually placed near relevant text. Some
of the sidenotes refer to text in footnotes, and
the footnotes in this eBook are at the end of the
main text, not on their original pages.</p>

<p>The index was not systematically checked for
proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>The index often shortened page numbers in a
sequence, e.g., “144, 51, 52”. In this ebook,
those page numbers have been expanded to their
full size, e.g., “144, 151, 152”. However, it is
possible that some were missed.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_8">Page 8</a>: “éploye” was printed that way, without an
acute accent on the final “e”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_68">Page 68</a>: “Duc D’Elchingen” was printed as
“Due D’Elchingen”; changed here.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_387">Page 387</a>: “A present il est fini” was printed
that way, without an acute accent over the “e”
in “present”.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_413">Page 413</a>: “presentaient” was printed that way,
without an acute accent over the first “e”.
